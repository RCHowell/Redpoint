Follow the old logging road past the stone steps that lead to "Machete" and "Weed Eater". Stay on the old logging road (for a couple of minutes) until it passes between a couple of large boulders and drops back down to the creek. About 20-30 yards before the creek look for a very short but steep trail uphill on your left that crosses over a large dead tree. This will quickly connect with another old logging road that contours around and into the northern entrance of Hatton Hollow. The routes will be on your left just above the road. There will probably be several more routes in the future (including a few more bouldery ones). The approach should only take 5-10 minutes from Sunnyside. Stays sunny: South facing (morning sun).Follow the directions to Rebel Branch Hollow. Then continue to the Sunnyside climbing area on the opposite side of the hollow from the Bruisebrothers Wall. Follow the old logging road past the stone steps that lead to "Machete" and "Weed Eater".

This wall is on the south side of Hatton Hollow directly across the creek from the Bowling Alley.  It can be reached via an old logging road located near the mouth of the hollow.  Follow the logging road up and right into the south side of the hollow (if you mistakingly take the logging road that goes up and left to the north side then you will soon be at the heavily pocketed Bowling Alley).  Once you reach the cliffline go to the climbers left to locate the routes.  The recommended approach is to wade the creek into the entrance of Hatton Hollow. Wall Sun: Unknown

Be respectful.From the main parking area cross Hell creek using the footbridge and follow the road past two main turnoffs on the left, the second of which leads to the Bowman Fork climbing areas. Continue along the main road, passing a narrow dirt road on the left which is the trail for Chaos. Shortly after that you will see a short road on the right which is the trailhead for Highlands. Almost directly across from this is a wider road than the one leading to Chaos which angles uphill to the left. This is the road you want to follow to reach Alcatraz. Follow the road until you see an obvious very steep pocketed wall beginning on a wide ledge about 4 feet up. That is the Power Grid section of Chaos wall. Continue along the road and shortly you will locate a steep trail leading straight to the short and striking line, Silent Circle, which marks the beginning of Alcatraz. Wall Sun: Shade

Again, let the Grail guide you across the creek and continue following the trail across a floodplain and then left along old roadbed/trail. It will eventually end in a hollow where the sign for Camelot will direct you up the approach trail.... on second thought, let's not go to Camelot, 'tis a silly place. Wall Sun: Morning
3007	Chaos	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=wall&id=199	This wall is in property owned by RRGCC. Be respectful.Chaos is the section of cliff to the right of Serenity Point and left of Alcatraz. The rock is high quality and varies from vertical to slightly overhanging with some sections such as the Power Grid clocking in at steep. As with most north facing cliffs in the Red the rock can be covered in powdery lichen so bring a brush. From Serenity Point walk right along the trail until reaching a point where it heads downhill skirting the cliff. Chaos begins with the first cluster of routes on a vertical wall capped by a high roof where Live with a Curse can be found. It's also possible to reach Chaos without walking up the trail to Coopers Cove and Serenity Point. To approach this way continue walking along the main dirt road as if going to Highlands or Fruit Wall. Eventually an old logging road angles uphill to the left. Follow this road which branches to a trail leading uphill and ending just beneath Mike Mulligan. The wall faces north to northeast. 37.6417N -83.6802 WWall Sun: Shade

That's not to say that you won't suffer a tremendous forearm flame out here though. Bring a brush since the routes may still have a fine layer of powdery lichen. The stone is grey and solid and the holds tend to be subtle sloping pinches and underclings. From the main parking area cross the creek and walk the road passing two roads on the left. Continue without turning down either of these roads until reaching a short road on the right. There is a large boulder adjacent to the end of this short road. Turn down the road and follow it for about 100 feet then take a trail on the right which crosses a stream. Continue along the trail for about 10 minutes, crossing the stream six more times for a total of seven crossings.
