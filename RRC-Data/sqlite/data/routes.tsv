5	Keys in the Back of a Cadillac	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3488	Trad	140	5.11d	3	Park as for grays wall (currently park right before the ''bump" sign) hike uphill slightly to the left until you come across a 20ft dihedral capped by a roof. Climb the dihedral and traverse the roof to a ledge (a bit dirty at the moment but the more traffic the cleaner it becomes) Pitch 2: Wide crack all the way too the right on the ledge. Climb on crappy quality rock for about 30 feet to another ledge. Pitch 3: This is the money pitch! Directly above pitch 2 is a beautiful dihedral with a thin fingers crack leading to a 12 foot roof which opens to hand/fist size and has some fun gymnastical moves then leads back to some face climbing to another ledge. Here i recommend breaking it into a fourth pitch to reduce rope drag for the last 20 feet to the top.	5	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bf1d97266665,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bf1d89b1cb1f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bf1d86259dd5,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bf1d83629f61,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bf1d4b4c3de7	0

About half way to Block and Tackle look up at a thin crack in a wide dihedral on a ledge, which is under an S-shaped crack opening into an offwidth. This line was ignored until 2017 probably due to the apparent lack of protection for 25 feet, but has a small pocket (BD 0.2) and a horizontal (BD 0.75) for openers, with good protection the rest of the way. Reserve a BD 3 or BD 6 for the OW bottom, and a BD 5 for the OW. The OW ends at a beautiful, circular hueco (diameter of about 2.5 meters) in which one can comfortably Vitruvian Man stand.

Continue past Texas Tea and Block and Tackle. Go past Sugar Daddy, wherever it is. Continue along the wall through some rhodos. A ledge about ten feet high will appear to your left. Continue along this ledge through some more rhodos. Pass a few gulleys that head up to the ledge. When you can see a flake feature above the ledge and a gulley that will allow you to access the ledge, scramble up and then to the left. This route starts as a tight hands splitter and then quickly becomes a flake. Climb up the flake, reaching around it frequently for a ridiculous number of perfect, hidden handholds. Brave the insecure mantle to gain a large ledge and belay trees, as well as a perfect view of Auxier Ridge, Courthouse Rock, and the rest of Long Wall. If you timed it right, enjoy the sunset over Auxier Ridge. The FAs were probably some cool old people long ago, but possibly Dan Beck and Nate Butcher in 2012.	44	10		0

Located across the street from Fortress and Phantasia is this open corner of towering rock. From the road you should be able to identify a large pine tree on the left hand side of the cliff that is about 30 feet from the top. This is the belay station for the final pitch of this route.To reach, follow directions for Dunkan Rock, but direct yourself one bluff south of Dunkan. Upon arriving at the bluff, walk around the left side until you spot a pair of cracks about 50 feet up. This is the start of the second pitch. Keep walking around left (north) side of bluff another 50 feet until you can scramble up a ramp that leads to your right. This begins the first pitch, which consists of a thin chimney to a large ledge (25 feet, 5.6).

Apologies in advance for the shameless promotion of my own route, but Tower of Power has a somewhat significant roof. In fact it is pretty cool, not your typical RRG type roof but more of a Gunks kind of problem. Geezer, it really shouldnt be too hard to spot. Directly above the crack that forms the first pitch you will see a flake that is somewhat detached from the roof above. Haul your ass up on to that flake and sit astride it in a kind of mambo? stance. You know what I mean, leaning way back, cause the roof will be right in your face. Reach way out to the lip and you will find a great hold, and best of all a bomber tricam (1.5 or maybe a 2) placement in a vertical crack (slotted, not cammed). Screw up your courage, pull the roof, and KEEP YOUR %#^ TOGETHER because its kinda run out on 5.10 face above. Its way exhilarating, and not nearly so hard as Insanity Ceiling. Together with the stupendous first pitch it is truly one of the best old school climbs in the gorge. I am really not trying to sandbag anyone. The first pitch starts out somewhat ugly and strange, then becomes beautiful beyond belief. Then there is the matter of the runout above the roof. Definitely a place where only the big boys and girls should play.

Belay on a huge platform from good gear. Pitches 1 and 2 would link with a lot of medium cams & runners. There is a tree for rapping here (no webbing as yet) if people are not psyched on the woolly wideness of p3.pitch 3: 5.9, 110'. Lieback up the corner crack on the left, past a dead tree, then into a perfect chimney with gear in the back. Near the top contort into the Yosemite-like slot and tunnel through for about 35' of moderate squeeze chimney (optional #5; small gear here and there).

From the previous set of lines continue right until reaching a large section of overhanging rock with upside down holds. This is the first line on this section of cliff and begins with easy climbing for 20 feet to reach a high first bolt. Climb the slightly overhanging face passing a couple of tough bouldery sections one of which contains a single natural perfectly placed make-or-break pocket. Grab a sit-down rest then tackle a roof with large holds that disappear shortly over the lip. The reward for making it this far is an enjoyable Red-Riveresque romp on large holds up a more overhanging and pumpy section of the wall.	26	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/51e32b9a3178c	0

Enjoy moves rarely used at the Red.	27	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/593dc86de5ecc	0
1467	Motor Booty Pimp Affair	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2106	Sport	95	5.10b	3.11	Before the slab ledge you will see a trail cutting down hill, after the boulder this is the first route you will come to.

Pull the tough start to get established in the offwidth, then continue until you come to a big hueco. Traverse left to another wide crack and set a belay. Pull another difficult offwidth start, come to another hueco, and cut left again, but now step out onto the slab and commit. Top it out, or make a sparsely protected traverse to the anchors on MBPA. If you only have a 60, you'll probably need to rap from the tree above MBPA and again from the anchors on that route. 2 pitches. Morning sun.	29	19		0
1469	Falkor	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2221	Trad	110	5.10d	3	Do the same hard offwidth start as Thunda Bunda, but blast straight up instead of cutting left. Wander back and forth a bit to find the best pro and sequences, enjoying the exposure and the spice. Top it out and belay. Go to the left to rap from a tree above Motor Booty Pimp Affair. If you only have a 60 meter you'll have to rap again off the Motor Booty Pimp Affair anchors in order to reach the ground.	30	19		0

Climb up several bolts on a pocketed face and then work your way through a couple of ledges to where the good climbing begins.

1725	R. Kelly Ethics	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2506	Trad	120	5.10c	3	To the right of EGBG, burl hard off the ledge and over the low roof. The finger-size gear at the roof is bomber, but quickly degrades in the next 10 ft. Ascend up and left around the arete. About 1/3 of the line overlaps with EGBG which veers left to its anchors. Stay trad, climbing straight up to top out through a techy offwidth (#4 + #5 BD). Belay your second from a tree. There is decking potential for the second at the ledge-roof start; the arete eats rope; and the top-rope sharply exalts the grade of the start. Drop the rope to the start of EGBG for the second. Rap off a tree (~7 m) down to the anchors of EGBG then to the ground.	7	18	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/507c59364de1d	0
1726	Icebreaker	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2509	Sport	85	5.12a	4.05	Just left of Eternal Fire is this high-quality climb at a comparatively moderate grade. Traverse the lip of the roof on heel hooks to gain the crux blunt arete followed by spectacular technical face climbing to the top of the wall.Get a spot and keep the rope slack for the first couple of moves, or just go old-school hang the first draw while climbing. The crux moves moving right at the third bolt are 12a for the reach- impaired.	8	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50869479ae3f0	0
1727	Eternal Fire	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2350	Sport	70	5.13c	5	50 feet right of Shootin' Hot Hugs is a gorgeous orange wall hosting two well sought after difficult lines.

1728	Cat's Demise	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2309	Sport	70	5.13b	4.89	Just right of Eternal Fire is another power sapper with easier opening moves but a tougher finish. Race past moderately steep pinches and slopers to a much needed rest before the last bolt. Shove a leg in, get everything back, then pick your poison. If you've got your crimpers trained up then reach straight up for a tiny right hand seam and pull hard on it to reach a high crimp then bust for the ledge. If you've logged some time on the slopes then instead of heading straight up, move left from the rest on insane pinches and slopers to reach the anchor ledge. Either way is a tough boulder problem. Bring a bail biner. You'll need it.	10	38	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564c01ef57aa8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564c0199e11b7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e1bd2924a4	0

Follow the crack until it fades then move up into some difficult cranking on small edges.

Climb the crack then scoot right onto the face for a rest for a couple of moves to reach the final decent rest before the showdown. Shift left back onto the face for the second half of the route which gets more difficult with each bolt run, until the holds diminish just in time for the finish.	17	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f9de6d545c89	0

Scramble up and look for the next crack system which appears to be a great line at first glance but apparently doesn't climb as well. There is no anchor so figure out a way down.	35	15	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/500210e6ce58f	0

Follow the road/trail for about 100 yards until it turns uphill and ends at a section of the cliff containing some bolted lines. This is the first on the left. Begin with a few big moves then race through sequential pockets and small crimps with no good rest to be had. Pull a small roof to gain the chains and throw a huge wobbler if you fall at this point because you have to do it all over again.	37	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ad665e476123,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ac95d564f34d,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4aaeea1a6469f	0
1757	Stalker	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2273	Sport	55	5.11d	3.44	Just right of Wobbler. Start with the comfort of a pair of good holds which quickly diminish to relentless crimping up the slightly overhanging face. Grab a good shake on a decent set of slots then crimp even harder through the obvious crux near the top. As with Wobbler, don't blow it going for the chains.	38	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4aaeea4b55de3	0

Climb moderate rock to reach an alcove where you will want to get the best protection you can.

If you survive the crack, traverse right then continue up on face holds with decent protection.	40	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50021257c0490	0
1760	Through The Looking Glass	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2274	Trad	75	5.11d	4	This is the overhanging acute dihedral right of the sport lines.

Take a deep breath then dive into relentless stemming and body smearing with difficult placements along the way.	41	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/500212d7e95e8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ab8362073263	0
1761	Malice	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2296	Sport	60	5.12c	4.65	Right of the previous dihedral is a concave, gold and black streaked wall with two bolted line. This is the left line and is a must do. Climb up a short, easy slab section to reach the overhang. Pop over to a large reinforced jug feature which may possibly be crowbarred off in the future. Reach hard for slopers, then leave the safety of the jugs for some of the best moves and holds the Red has to offer. While recovering after the overhang switch gears and make a difficult move to gain the vertical wall then relax to the chains.	42	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5002132099454,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4b09a4bd288f3	0

Get a last good piece and then run out the dirty slab to the top.	47	12	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4a91e44a34892	0
1767	End of the Innocence	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2292	Trad	80	5.10b	3	Walk 25 feet left of Sugar Rush to a crack at the left end of the roof 10 feet up.

1768	Sugar Rush	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2267	Sport	65	5.10a	2.93	This and the following two routes are right of Down the Rabbit Hole but it's best to walk back down to the old logging road and head back toward the fork near the top of the main trail. Look for a large boulder on your left with a trail bordering the left side. Head shortly uphill to meet up with these routes. This is the first on the left. Positive holds lead to a ''made for side-pulling" move that leads you to briefly thinner terrain and a rail.Continue up to be rewarded with a few true slab moves. Go left, go right, go straight up, just go and don't forget to step up after clipping the chains for a good view behind you.	49	16		0
1769	Augustus Gloop	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2268	Sport	60	5.9	2.89	Right of Sugar Rush.

If you followed the main trail up to the cliff instead of taking the left branch up to Cat's Demise then continue straight past the obvious trail on the left near the top of the trail to the next trail on the left which leads directly up to these routes. Take the next trail on the left which leads straight up to a vertical wall containing several bolted lines. This is the leftmost line and begins with some bulge wrestling to reach the less demanding face above.	55	23		0

Johnathan's excellent description of the moves follows: ''After some easy initial climbing, the route fires directly into a very serious boulder problem on thin, very sharp edges, finishing with a wild, all-points-off sideways dyno to a resting jug. From here the route carries on with difficult lock-offs on crimps and pockets to surprisingly frequent, albeit worsening rests. Towards the top lies the a longest section of uninterrupted hard climbing that finishes with a reachy, shouldery lock-off (redpoint crux). There is a solid rest at the final bolt before you climb a series of pockets and long moves guarding the chains." If that's not enough beta for you then search for the many videos on the tubes.

This route is the first line encountered and begins just right of a crack. Climb finger pockets to a ego busting crux near the third bolt.

From the ledge, make a scary clip then smack right to reach your friend for the next few bolts, Mr. Fat Flake. Dig and squeeze while slapping for chalk spots. You won't be alone if you pull up a stick clip at this point. Wire the bottom of The Nothing now and you can do the route the way Dave Hume intended it to be done.	22	38		0
1680	The Nothing	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=852	Sport	90	5.14a	3.6	This route begins by climbing a faint crack system about 15 feet right of the previous route. A gimme 5.14 for those who spent the winter in Hueco. Hopefully that'll help give it some love. Remember though, Dave doesn't think it's 5.14. Will that detract the chasers?

1684	Angry Birds	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2337	Sport	100	5.13c	4.78	Next route right of Pimp Juice. Work up a pump to meet the beast at bolt 5. Bust through the first boulder problem to reach a ledge. Exit when ready then rage through 3 more bolts of insanity, complete with a Madness-like sloping beach move. Milk a recovery jug for all it's got then bust another boulder problem and dive for the toilet seat. One more long move gets you to the chains where you can be glad everything fell into place just right.	26	39	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5e06322c65cc2,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408b7e6c388d,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408b7da1ff9e	0

Pace yourself and save enough juice to enjoy the last 20 feet of excellent climbing that makes it all worthwhile. Apparently climbers have discovered a lay-down no hands rest before the final crux. 12d? Time will tell.	27	37	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4fd936e278289,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4fd936a0812ba	0

1689	Arachnophobia	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2343	Sport	0	5.12d	2	This route lies on the right side of the amphitheater just off the trail leading to Bob Marley Crag. The line involves a cruxical first half before reaching the familiar steep jug hauling the Red is famous for. Don't spray the ''almost onsite" if you fall going for the chains though because it may happen way more than once. It's tough up there.	30	33	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50341974e05ba	0

1692	Captain Turtlehead	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2618	Mixed	80	5.9+	3	Clip the first bolt of Pottsville, then move up and left to the crack. Follow this to the top, trending right up high on the juggy slab to the Pottsville anchor. Lots of lichen but very solid rock, a sort of ''North Carolina training" route. A #4 to 5 Camalot or two helpful.	33	13		0

Stem up into the chimney and pull the roof. Proceed straight up the George of the Jungle crack until it takes a 90 degree turn to the right. Step up and slightly left onto the face and proceed directly upward through the line of three bolts to the anchors.	35	15		0
1696	George of the Jungle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1473	Trad	0	5.9	3	25 ft. right of Mud on the Rug is a crack that starts about 20ft off the ground.

This is the leftmost line. Jam a short crack to reach a distorted hueco beneath the 3rd bolt. Step up onto the face to begin climbing through several cruxes requiring lots of foot switching and bitching about no holds.	37	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ede95c1949a8	0

Grovel onto the face making use of sloping ledges which just don't feel as good as you want them to. Once you get your ass over the hump it's just fun climbing to the chains.	39	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e10eb3f166,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ede96b6b5c0b,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ede969dbff68	0
1700	Murder at Frozen Head	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2398	Sport	65	5.11b	3	Begin on a flat boulder. Climb the face to reach a no hands rest on a ledge. Tiptoe off the ledge onto the face then back onto the ledge several times until your belayer seems irritated then commit to anything you can grab to make the leg shaking clip. If you make it to the 4th you got it in the bag.	40	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50341b85516bf,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ede9738905de	0
1701	Amyloid Plaque Sport	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2399	Sport	60	5.13a	2.5	A 5.13a slab line? It probably doesn't need a description because nobody else will climb it. It's the blank one with no holds. Looks killer though.	41	37	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ede976bb0bf9	0
1702	Dementia	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2400	Trad	65	5.6	2.67	Angling crack which trends left to join Amyloid Plaque at the chains.

Move up past some nice moves to a hole just before the chains. From the hole, peek out and stare at the chains for awhile while you wonder how you can reach them without falling.	43	18	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ede97b8563ce	0

Very green near the beginning but also steep with big holds. How desperate are you for that pump? The finish may make it worth your while.	15	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534bff2a05778	0
2251	Leaning Tower	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2901	Sport	70	5.12a	2.5	A pair of lines ascend the overhanging tower left of Gymkhana. This is the right route and the better of the two.

2217	Skunk love	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1594	Sport	65	5.11b	4.5	Another tough slab line right of Stirrin' the Grits. This one is actually doable for non-slab masters.	4	24		0
2218	Stirrin' the Grits	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2386	Sport	65	5.11c	3.29	Just left of Skunk Love lies this slab on solid stone. Bring out your inner trad game for three bolts, and then ponder how in the world the next moves could only be 5.11. Unlock that puzzle, and an airy run to bolt five guarantees you will stir yer grits.	5	25		0
2219	Believer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1294	Sport	60	5.11b	3.98	This line is the first bolted route encountered after walking through the arch.

2224	The Proverbial Donkey	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1511	Trad	100	5.11a	0	Start in an alcove 20ft. left of Dracula behind a large, spearhead boulder. Work up the face to gain a fist crack in a roof. A fall before here would be very bad with the spine of the boulder directly below you. Note, the second is also in danger of swinging into the boulder as you cannot protect the low section. Work up the crack system over several ledges until a comfy belay ledge directly under a 15ft. roof. Bail out here for a higher quality climb at 5.10b R or continue out the roof on shakey jams and bad feet to chain anchors just past the lip of the roof. 60m. rope required.	11	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399bbec50fc7	0

Climb relatively easy moves to the third bolt then bust left through a V7 boulder problem to reach a quick shake at the fourth bolt. Recharge then boulder through a more difficult section to reach a moderate rest at the fifth bolt. From the fifth, endure the redpoint run to the break.

2047	Twenty Four Karats	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1067	Sport	65	5.14c	0	Just right of God's Own Stone used to be two long standing open projects. In November of 2010, visiting climber Jonathan Siegriest combined the top half of the first project with bottom half of the second project to create this exceptional line. A bolt was added to link the two and the old bolts were removed then later re-added to the right line to bring back the original project. The climbing consists of deadpoints and delicate movement on shallow pockets and sloping edges.	18	46	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534bca68a700d	0

Begin with a big cross move to a pocket then bust up to a flake. Ride the flake to enter a sea of pockets and edges.

They are located ~100 ft above the sidewalk-sized traverse ledge mentioned in the directions to Coyote Cliff. To reach these routes you will need to back track past the short 4th class slot/3rd class gully area and find a faint trail leading up to another exposed ledge above. It may be necessary to make a supersketchy traverse high above the lower traverse ledge to reach a giant balcony above that contains more rock. This route is a few feet left of an obvious left-leaning flake.	1	3		0

Originally thought to be a trad route, but the gear wasn't good enough to keep it from being R-rated. A reachy start on good jugs takes you to a ledge from which you can step left and cruise the crack above. Technical and enjoyable. First route put up at Coyote Cliff.

A bouldery start will lead to a small cave (beware of the woodrats). Carefully climb the crack and flake to gain the pocketed face above.

Hang on for the last 25 ft on the headwall and you're there.	6	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408bf14e4468,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5267c1249115d,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5267c0c7dcfce,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5267c04beab49,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ecd96583b75e,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ecd9594ddb2b,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/453bd723566f8	0

Make a long move then continue up easier ground to a two-bolt anchor on the ledge. Belay, rappel off here, or continue up ''Heard It On NPR".	3	17	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/Spidercrux.jpg	0
2719	Cordillera Rojo	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1570	Sport	115	5.11a	1.85	A not so great adventure climb with lots of bad rock on the second pitch.Start immediately right of ''Spider Crux" and left of "Barenjager". Follow 4 bolts to the ledge system, rest as long as your conscience will allow, and launch up the unrelenting and imposing headwall above. A 70 meter rope is not long enough to lower off, so it needs to either be done in 2 pitches (there is an intermediate anchor) or the climber will have to figure out how to set up a rappel.	4	23		0
2720	Barenjager	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1139	Sport	40	5.10d	3.42	This route ascends the overhanging face 10-15 ft. right of Spider Crux. Follow a line of 4 bolts up pockets, flakes, and edges to a 2 bolt anchor.	5	19	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/44c93407c8a86,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/44c933ece59d3,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/Barenjager.jpg	0
2721	Brushfire Fairytales	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1140	Sport	40	5.11a	3.71	Start 10-15 ft. right of previous route. Similar to Barenjager, but slightly harder with bigger, pumpier moves and a sequential crux.	6	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4cdf7611e42e2	0
2722	Tradmill	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1141	Trad	40	5.7	3.2	Climb obvious left-leaning ramp. Step around this obstacle then cruise up the left-leaning ramp over a small bulge. Clip the chain anchors on the left or continue into the cave. Build an anchor in the enormous cave and belay or traverse left along the ledge to ''Spider Crux" anchors.	7	6	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/43b9bfec780c7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/Tradmill.jpg	0
2723	Sticks and Stones	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1142	Mixed	35	5.11+	5	Begin at base of Tradmill. Climb up to roof and hand traverse 10-15 ft. right to gain handcrack. Place some gear, then crank through the thinning and steepening crack to a good horizontal. Clip the bolt and make the move to the jug. Crimp your way to the anchors.	8	27	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/43b9bfaac89d7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/SticksandStones.jpg	0
2724	Bad Dentures	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1143	Toprope	70	5.9	0	First recorded route done in Muir Valley. Walk 100 ft. right of Sticks and Stones. Follow ledge system up to an arete that is often wet. Climb left side of slabby arete to a large ledge with a tree.	9	12		0
3162	Silent Circle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3157	Sport	45	5.12d	3.4	From the power grid walk back down to the road and continue right along the wall looking for a short trail after about 100 feet. This trail leads to a nice overhanging section of cliff which unfortunately is characterized by swampy ground at the base. It's short but promises to pack a punch that hits you square in the eye right at the chains.	1	33	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450e9d3cce2b,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545040d6479e1	0
3163	Nerves of Steel	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3158	Sport	70	5.11b	2.25	Begin as for Silent Circle but cut right and swing up the wall to a high ledge. Surmount the roof and finish with a couple bolts worth of airy edge climbing.	2	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450e9b9aca8d	0
3164	Jericho	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3159	Sport	50	5.11c	3	Don't let the appearance of the start keep you away from this one. Climb up to a triangular roof at mid height. Finagle a rest then exit into the wickedly cool crux.	3	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54ed258c730a5,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54ecf8f2f1c23,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450413d5bfca	0
3165	Black Feather	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3160	Sport	50	5.11d	3	The last route on the right before the arete for this section of the wall. Start with a couple of dirty moves, which quickly merge with power pulls on deep pockets culminating in a potentially desperate toss to a small hueco. As with the other lines on the wall if you can deal with the dirty start you will be rewarded with some great movement.	4	26		0
3166	Blake's arête	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3161	Toprope	25	Unknown	5	A short toprope problem on the arete right of Black Feather. Equipped by Blake Bowling.	5	9999		0
3167	Matrix (Open Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3162	Sport	45	5.14	0	Right of the previous group of lines, the wall takes on a striking angular nature. This open project awaits the no-holds body English masters. Equipped by Kipp Trummel in 2014.	6	43	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511c39ec8ab,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450417eab830	0
3168	Nightmare in the Beauty	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3163	Sport	70	5.12c	4.33	Just around the corner from Matrix is what may be one of the nicest looking walls in the area. The climbing on this wall holds up to its beauty. However this line could be a nightmare for the less creative climber in us. Begin with high tips in a crack and toss up to a horn. The rest is up to your imagination. Enjoy.	7	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450eafe2e42d,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545041932201f	0
3169	Cursing Kirk	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3164	Sport	70	5.11c	3.57	It's a reachy one! Lobster claw pinching buys you a sit down rest on the ledge. The sequel requires some endurance and enough juice to make a couple of difficult long pulls. Go big or go small at the upper crux.	8	25		0
3170	Birdman	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3165	Sport	70	5.11c	3.6	Sequential underclinging and sidepulling gets you to the sit-down ledge. Mostly decent holds minus an obvious teeny tiny crimpy cruxy up high.	9	25		0
3171	Creepy Karpis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3166	Sport	70	5.11c	1.67	This line was already in place long before the land purchase and lacked a few bolts critical for keeping the climber off the ground and the ledge. It's safer now but still wanders a bit. Regardless it's another good line if you can pull the initial reachy moves.	10	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5759cc01be804	0
3172	Dope on a Rope	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3167	Sport	70	5.11b	3.56	The juggier and steeper of the lines on this wall. Reach high for a deep horizontal to pull over a small roof and into a quick pockety section. After that, enjoy the fun flow of good old fashioned Red River steep jug hauling complete with a no-hands double knee bar rest. Remember though, another trait of those old fashioned jug hauls is to spit in your face right at the chains.	11	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450e74c89bf3,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545041ef44790	0
3173	Traumatized Turtle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3168	Sport	55	5.9+	2.31	Continue right along the cliffline for about 150 feet to meet up with a trio of routes on a geometric face. This is the first on the left and follows large ledges up the low angled face.	12	13	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5640f072ae116	0
3174	Regulation Number Five	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3169	Sport	55	5.12c	3	Begin as for Traumatized Turtle but exit right near the first bolt. Mantel up to a distinct crux toss to a decent edge using the best foot smear you can find. 5.9 moves lead to a perplexing thin tips crack finish.	13	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450421a3a4bc	0
3175	Scruff Puppy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3170	Sport	60	5.12a	3.4	A sequential and difficult face climb leads to a right angling mega steep pump delivering arete. Pull up into a pod making use of sketchy looking but solid orange blobby rock. The line was originally going to end at the second set of chains but deemed too difficult for old guys.	14	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511dac08ce1,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511ca9ae714	0
3176	Square Bob Sponge Pants	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3171	Sport	80	5.11a	3.14	Continuing along the trail takes you to a pair of long lines just right of a crack and before the trail heads downhill to a flat spot. This begins either in the crack or on the face beneath the bolt. Cruxy movement leads through enough rests to keep the grade moderate. An excellent roof pull guards the chains.	15	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54504265b22c4	0
3177	Slingo	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3172	Sport	80	5.11b	3.67	Just right of Square Bob is another long journey through off-balance twisted movement up a striking arete with some extra spice thrown in. Think Prime Directive.	16	24		0
3178	Reign of Terror (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3173	Sport	85	Unknown	0	Head down from the previous lines to another pair of lines clocking in somewhat harder. This is the left line. Equipped by Kipp Trummel, 2014.	17	9999		0
3179	Fatal Vision	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3174	Sport	85	5.11c	4.78	Begin in a thin flake system and climb the long face and arete using every trick in the book. Sneak around to the right if you are feeling perplexed. One of the better lines on this section of cliff.	18	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450429bbb2a5	0
3180	The Motherland	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3175	Sport	70	5.12d	0	This odd route begins on the arete right of Fatal Vision but actually climbs to a ledge about 30 feet up where it's possible to walk back down to where you started so you can pull your rope and not do the rest of the route.	19	33		0
3181	Poking a Dead Frog	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3176	Sport	60	5.11c	3.2	Just around the corner from Fatal Vision and right of a gorgeous corridor is a tall wall with several lines. This is the first on the left and begins on a boulder. A sequential array of slopers eases up long enough to prepare you for the vicious crimps at top. Glue ins.	20	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545042ba1fc6f	0
3182	Red Fern	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3177	Sport	70	5.11c	3.38	This quality line begins on the same boulder as Dead Frog. Reach for a sloping ledge at the start and pop up into a small hueco for some great technical yet pumpy climbing.	21	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe06c846f5,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe035899ca,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545042e0f1acb	0
3183	Man with a Wooden Leg	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3178	Sport	70	5.10c	2.8	There are two lines exiting the large orange hueco roof blob. This is the left one. Traverse a dirty shelf to reach the roof and pull on precarious jugs to get onto the face where the fun begins. A variety of underclings, crimps, and high steps make this route fairly technical but it still overhangs enough to deliver a nice pump. Glue ins.	22	18		0
3184	Sweet Petunia	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3179	Sport	70	5.10d	2.31	Traverses the same dirty shelf to start but begins a bit further right. A bit more sustained than Wooden Leg with a much harder crux exiting the hueco up high.	23	19	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe0e4b345f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe0bd3c365	0
3185	Maximum Security AZ-1441	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3914	Sport	120	5.11c	3.75	This escape from Alcatraz requires at least a 70 meter rope. Downhill, to the climber's right of Sweet Petunia, stand on a large boulder that sits above the drainage. Lean forward to touch rock; crank up and left to the obvious ledge. Shoulder through the short, forbidding offwidth section to stand on the prow. Climb straight up to the roof and take a hard right; the line trends up and right from here. A few stays of execution alleviate the length of the route. When you reach the chains above the large hueco, savor the vista of the sprawling valley bounded by box canyon. Use the permanent gear to direct your rope on the way down to efficiently remove your draws.	23	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5f4eae56320f9,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5f4ea4181c6d5,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5f4ea37903b5f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5f4ea226116cd	0
3186	Flight Risk	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3180	Sport	95	5.12a	3	Walk down from the previous group of lines and through a marshy alcove to reach this line. Tough moves with decent rests make up the first half while a more sustained section takes you to the chains. Be sure to use a full 60m rope.	24	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/562eb398417e4,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450faf254ffa	0
3203	Huge Tracts of Sand	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3663	Trad	45	5.8	0	This is the first corner at end of approach trail. Do not climb. No anchors, rap from tree on left side of finish ledge. What's wrong with her? She's beautiful, she's rich, she's got huge... tracts of... sand! This rock is pure choss and too soft for anchors.	1	9		0
3204	Brave Sir Robin	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3664	Sport	45	5.10c	2.65	Start on the flake/slab. After the no hands rest get through the fingery section to finish on jugs. This route would not be suitable for a top rope because of rope drag at the anchors. It is slightly overhung. When danger reared its ugly head he quickly turned his tail and fled.	2	18	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bcc936995e5f	0
3205	Chicken of Augnor	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3665	Sport	30	5.8	2.36	Go 20 feet to the right of Brave Sir Robin to find this slab of easy climbing with a little arete.	3	9	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5b9da5bc5e7df,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5b9da3ea8607b	0
3206	Bring out Your Dead	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3666	Trad	30	5.9	1	Follow the cliffline to the right and turn the corner. In 20 feet you will find this route and other routes. Starts as an offwidth and quickly narrows to an overhung. You may feel fine, but this one is no walk.	4	12		0

3081	Diesel Therapy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2673	Sport	60	5.11a	3.45	An excellent line which begins with jugs in a dihedral of sorts. A great warm-up for the wall.

3082	Road Kill	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2672	Sport	60	5.10c	3.63	A stellar but tough line for the grade.

3083	Pure Pleasure	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2671	Sport	60	5.11b	3.58	The name says it all. Begin with a few bolts of bouldery moves on decent pockets to reach a great straddle rest, which could possibly be pleasureful, if you're inclined. Continue on through great movement to reach a thin tricky move with a few different options just before the chains.	7	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a1ab643e7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a19107557,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a18042ca4,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b0656e8ac	0
3084	Addiction	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2670	Sport	60	5.11c	3.61	Just left of Pure Pleasure is what may be the best line on the wall. Bust through a low sidepull crux to gain enjoyable moves on big holds. Difficult height dependent moves on angled small crimps guard the last couple of bolts before the chains. If you're out left staring up and over at the chains about to say take just go big! Stick clipping the second bolt may prevent unnecessary wandering.	8	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b2095a8ad,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b0e99af94	0

An easy approach to a low pocket crux opens up to gigantic, solid jugs to reach a nearly no-hands rest mid-height. More jugs entice you into a final sequence of tough pulling to reach the chains. Equipped with glue-in bolts.	10	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54e2172b3f9c7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54e216124b550	0
3087	Poop Dolla!!	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2668	Sport	55	5.11b	3	Opposite the joke this is more like shit on top of the dollar. What appears as a pile actually climbs quite nicely. The line goes straight up from the last bolt so if it's wet to the left at top it is probably still okay to climb.	11	24		0
3088	The Devil in the White City	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2780	Sport	60	5.12a	2.44	Start from cheater stones right of a large tree.

3090	The Hustle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2667	Sport	60	5.11b	3.85	A close contender with Addiction for the best route on the wall. Begin left of the 6 foot high roof with a blocky right hand and reach high for a left crimp to get started.

3092	Lick Your Wounds	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3768	Sport	60	5.11a	2.25	This route is the furthest left on the main wall.

3094	Work Therapy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3060	Sport	60	5.11c	3.63	This line has a tufa-like feature which just begs to be climbed. A short approach gets you to the tufa where proper execution of moves will prevent the ol' barndoor from swinging open. Big moves between big holds on steepening rock make up the second half of the line.	17	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/551ec98d6fb8b,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508cae5e320b,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544993cfc07c1	0
3095	Unstable Behavior	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3059	Sport	70	5.12a	2.63	Stick clip the high first bolt to start. Hand traverse a ledge then move quickly past blobby, fragile feeling jugs for a hands free ledge. More easy stop and go ledge and slot climbing leads to one difficult move after which the jugs begin again. This may be the best definition of a one-move wonder.	18	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508c96c66d43	0
3096	Head Case	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3058	Trad	40	5.9	4	This traditionally protected line shares anchors with Self Medication. Gear placements can be a bit advanced so be sure to bring your A game. Or just reach around the corner and clip the bolts.	19	12		0
3097	Self Medication	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3057	Sport	40	5.11c	3.67	Don't walk past this just because it's short. Just left of an overhanging arete is a short line of bolts. A long move leads into a quick but fun run on crimps.

Use the tree, or don't, to reach decent slots and edges which become large finger ledges near the top. This line serves as a good way to reach the ledge routes if you don't want to scramble up the muddy gully further right.Pitch 2 (5.12b)- continues over the roof from the ledge and adds an extra 60 feet with 7 bolts.	6	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55078994b1b8a	0

2957	Hot Mess	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3006	Sport	65	5.11a	3.25	LEDGE ROUTE: The sport route just left of the Awkward Threesome crack. Begin on a large pile of cheater stones and jump for a jug in the roof. Good holds over the lip lead to a nice, mellow ride on orange and black jugs. A potentially dangerous runout from the last bolt to the chains may be eliminated with the addition of a bolt eventually. If you see eight bolts then you are good. If you see seven, be careful.	9	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508aa0ac12ec	0
2958	Awkward Threesome	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2966	Trad	70	5.11a	3.67	LEDGE ROUTE: This wandering, naturally protected face climbing is located on a ledge above and right of Chimney Sweep.

2959	Compulsion	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2967	Sport	65	5.11b	4	LEDGE ROUTE: Just right of Awkward Threesome is another fair line which also begins with a low roof.

2961	Geller's Spoon	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2968	Sport	100	5.11a	3.5	Walk right from the previous group of ground level lines to reach this bolted line, which marks the beginning of the serene, pine laden section of the cliff. Start in left-facing scoop marked by black bolt hangers.

2962	Capsaicin Sea	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2969	Sport	105	5.11b	3.88	A thin crack beginning gets you into a muddy fat flake with a tree growing from it, making for several good root jugs. Ladder up on large iron oxide ledges and a couple of long moves to finish in a challenging groove. Currently there is good potential for a ledge fall between bolts 6 and 7 and possibly 7 and 8 so don't fall or don't climb it.	13	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/538951b4c6daa,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5359e126236cf	0
2963	Symbiosis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2970	Mixed	90	5.11b	4.06	Either climb the crack far left of the first bolt (which is also the first pitch of Histoplasmosis) or the mossy face beneath it to start this unbelievably good face climb. A roof pull at the fifth bolt is the gateway to exposed and wild ride that is well worth the entry fee. If you bypass the crack, be careful clipping the second bolt and take a #3 Camalot to protect the run to the third. The remainder is well bolted. Note that the two glue-in bolts making up the alternate start of this line may be pulled by the FA at some point.	14	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254be682243,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254bc766dbd,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53139fcf7977f	0
2964	Histoplasmosis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2972	Trad	80	5.10c	4.2	This 2 pitch line begins by climbing the flake that also makes up the first pitch of Symbiosis. Where Symbiosis cuts left out of the flake and onto the bolted face, this line is accessed by continuing up the crack and into the cave instead of cutting left. A wide roof crack offers plenty of jugs hidden within.	15	18	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/531ba0a533f61	0

3151	The Guillotine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2809	Sport	75	5.13b	3	On the opposing wall left of The Abyss is a pair of lines on the vertical to overhanging wall. Precarious movement leads to a roof where creative footwork is crucial to holding the swing while slapping for the good hold. Equipped by John Flunker in 2013.

3152	The Abyss	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2810	Sport	90	5.12d	4.6	Just left of Adult Swim is this sustained masterpiece which leads through a large roof where a long reach will dictate your effort level. Unclipping the fifth and skipping the second fixed chain will reduce the rope drag.

Begin with high iron oxide edges then pull up into a nose-feature where the difficult climbing begins.

3156	Half Mast	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2814	Sport	55	5.11b	3.63	The obvious fin arete. Negotiate a low bulge with awkward moves at the first bolt to make a somewhat sketchy second clip. Take on the face making use of the rounded arete when possible. The longer your reach the less chance of needing to leave the comfort of the arete for more difficult crimping on the face.	12	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5525f0a9ce195,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a216130a1b6	0

Near the middle pass a tempting ledge to the left and run it out on big holds to the next bolt where the moves get even bigger.	14	17	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/571f68f0c7c46,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/565be9bc3fbc9,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a216279ba5d	0

3100	Pineapple Express	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3112	Sport	50	5.12a	3.95	On the right side of the main wall is a shorter section with a ledge where this and the next few routes begin from. Reach over the initial roof for a jug then launch into big reaches and mostly moderate climbing with a brief boulder problem mid-route.	2	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54079ee530d98,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54078044c6c27	0
3101	Breakfast at Koops	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3018	Sport	60	5.11d	4.57	Pumpy and excellent! Begin as for Pineapple Express but trend left after the first bolt. Race up through a sustained series of angular holds which become pockets and sloping pinches as the angle steepens.	3	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564a7ec3cbf39,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544afd822267f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5405344107160,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5405337b6edb2,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f1b374f570	0
3102	J's on my Feet	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3017	Sport	70	5.12c	3	This line also begins on the ledge on the right side of the main wall. It shares the first four bolts with another line so don't let that confuse you if you're counting routes. Climb straight up without bailing left at the fourth. Originally the line was bolted to meet up with a wicked, razorcrimp crux but new bolts were added to avoid it. It's now a more doable, killer line that won't split your tips!	4	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564d5684007b8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/547e8f26bafaa,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5359b6727ad4a,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f1af426538	0

3105	Flaccid Fruit	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3003	Sport	90	5.12b	3.43	This one-move wonder for the one pump chumps begins left of the ledge from which the previous routes began. Thick skin and the desire to send is required due to the small, sharp split-maker crimps.	7	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544aff836bf12	0
3106	Fruits of my Loins	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3002	Sport	95	5.12d	4	The first bolted line right of the crack splitting the middle of the wall. Begin with some difficult bouldering then launch into a long journey of pumpy climbing with an exciting run or two. Stick clip the third bolt if it hasn't been moved. You'll know if it's directly above the second bolt and tough to clip from the obvious holds on the right.	8	33	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5739ebf204532,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdba7198e6,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdb5c3bb14	0
3107	Hourglass Crack	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3016	Trad	100	5.10d	4.6	The obvious overhanging crack splitting the main wall at its highest point. You will actually feel pretty cool on this because you are guaranteed to climb higher than whoever is left and right of you. Jingle those cams and grunt really loudly while talking about how lame sport climbing is. Then pull your stuff up, yell down ''zero bolts bitches!", and rappel down from a tree far away from the climbers you just pissed off. Or lower from the chains and run.	9	19	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5563c6e668b9e,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5546b67227518,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553ed1563d9d7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54a7235581371,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54a72344dc0b6,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/540686362ed66,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f1c99c1959	0
3108	Banana Hammock	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3000	Sport	95	5.12a	4.08	Just left of the crack splitting the main wall is this line marked by an obvious protrusion near the third bolt. A sequence of challenging sidepull moves leads to the mandatory nut rest on the protrusion. Progress through immensely pumpy edges and hidden pockets separated by decent rests.	10	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/58fd97fc23ac8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/56fb46977fc67,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55c9588d5c404,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/555966f3c44fb,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5556d5bb0c14c,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdb060fbff,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdad35523f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fda74d961c,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d993d66b09	0

A low roof serves as the entry gate to a long run on gigantic jugs. Nothing but fun.	11	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/58992716a5d19,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5556d532cebea,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fd8f734ddb,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544af853954e7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53dc59679bdd0,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d9925ede6a	0
3110	Cannibal Queen	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3015	Sport	80	5.12c	3.5	A line of shallow pockets leads to a roof crux. Sustained climbing around a discontinuous crack system on the slightly overhanging face ends with a wise anchor placement in a roof just before an often wet brown streak.Bad pockets to low roof crux to killer slightly overhanging finish section.	12	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f19b3e5563	0
3111	Grapes of Wrath (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3101	Sport	80	5.13+	4	Ends at anchors right of the large notch at the top of the wall. A stopper boulder problem prevents this from being the jug haul you think it would be. Equipped by Shadow Ayala.	13	41		0
3112	Watermelon Crawl	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3464	Sport	95	5.12c	4	Start in the dihedral left of Grapes of Wrath.

3113	Conkle Donkle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3013	Sport	90	5.12c	3	What rhymes with Conkle? At the top of the cliff is a large notch extending nearly halfway down the wall. This is the first line left of the notch. Climb up through a roof left of a black and tan crack. Stick with it for the second half where the movement and rock quality greatly improve.	14	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544afa8a0ec34,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d981a019d8	0
3114	Bumpers & Bogs	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3012	Sport	95	5.12c	2.67	As with Conkle Donkle, put your time in at the bottom for the reward of steeper climbing and better rock quality up higher. A nice rest preps you for the final kickback of the wall where the moves require some serious try-hard.Progressively harder moves lead to a big rest before the wall kicks back and changes to bullet hard rock for the last two or three bolts and the business up top. Heart breaker style, last 3 or 4 moves are the hardest. Tie a knot in the end of your rope!	15	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d988282730	0
3115	Artifact	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3116	Sport	95	5.12b	3	Begin on Bumpers and Bogs but trend left and up the mini dihedral after the first bolt.

3123	Peach Fuzz	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3213	Sport	50	5.11b	3.83	Continue left and downhill from the pair of short, easy lines. Turn a corner to meet up with a pair of lines on a bright orange section of wall. This is the right line of the two and follows a blunt arete and tufa-like feature. Don't walk past this line thinking it may not be worth the time.

2990	Grim Reaper	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2689	Sport	100	5.12a	4.59	Located on the intimidating steep grey wall this line is one of the best of the grade. You will rarely find a route this long and this steep with holds so big your fingers disappear when you grab them. The fun comes with an entry fee though consisting of a tough boulder problem followed by a slightly technical face climb. If you make it past that channel your inner Tarzan and let the swinging begin.	1	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564bf25523e36,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235af4453b52	0

The crux in the middle is technical and height dependent. Don't expect a gimme though even if you have the reach because the pump will still be there.	2	37	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554f81ea18737,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525e98f6323cf	0

A long and tensiony move gets you onto the steep arete loaded with sinker pockets and wrapper jugs. Exit the arete into dynamic moves spanning the extent of the average climber's reach. When in doubt just launch and know it will be good.	3	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545ffb602bedd,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545ff8a673ca1,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b30a9f22c	0
2993	Grave Digger	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2692	Mixed	70	5.11a	4	Just before a gully in the trail is this pocketed dihedral plagued with a chossy start. If you can stomach the beginning the corner will make you forget about it. A bolted vertical face takes this one beyond the crack. Bring small gear for the corner and a big cam for the chossy start.	4	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b4c02b568	0

2997	The Cousin of Death	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2769	Sport	60	5.11d	3.5	This line takes on the stunning rounded arete around the corner from Pall Bearer crack. A shin buster start leads to the arete which requires creative hand shuffling and on-the-go foothold ticking. This one is far from straightforward.	8	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5304c48d6e275	0
2998	Evil Dead	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2770	Sport	60	5.12a	3	Around the corner from Cousin of Death is a clean, easy looking slab loaded with bolts. This is the first on the right and requires seasons in Tuolumne or some sort of wizardry to ascend. 4 stars if you like slab, -5 stars if you don't.	9	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/526fbc5b307f1	0
2999	Smoking the Dark Crystal	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2771	Sport	60	5.12a	4	Another wickedly difficult slab climb also requiring wizardry but also the addition of some witchcraft.	10	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/548095560dc53	0
3000	Pet Cemetery	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2772	Sport	60	5.11c	4	The leftmost slab climb on this section of wall before the trail dips. This one doesn't require wizardry or witchcraft, as the two to the right do, but some sort of luck will definitely come in handy.	11	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/556738d341c19	0
3001	Unmarked Grave	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2773	Sport	60	5.11b	3	This slab is marked by a hueco at arms reach with assist from a pile of cheater stones. Heave up into the hueco to meet a tough mantel move which situates you on the face. A continous series of of tricky moves allows for a break in the middle in a body sized hueco. When the toes are ready for more come out da hole to tiptoe some mo.	12	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554c123dd8c0b	0
3002	Ghost Dog	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2774	Sport	70	5.11d	1.67	Climb out of a crusty blob and over a low roof for 50 feet of easy climbing corroded white jugs ending at a hard move on sandy holds. Are you enticed?	13	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554c12585447e	0
3003	Rest in Pieces	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2775	Mixed	80	5.11c	4.5	Mixed line with a single bolt left of Ghost Dog. Gear beta (you may want this): Bring a .4 or yellow Alien and a 2'' cam to protect the moves after the runout on the face. You can also place a .75 immediately below the anchors to reduce leg shake.	14	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554364237338e,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553b07c6950c8	0
3004	Altered State	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3345	Trad	80	5.11c	4	The obvious steep left-leaning crack between RIP and DOA. Start up on the ledge by scrambling in from below DOA and belay from medium cams. A BD #5 is useful for the top crux but not required.	14	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5577aeb203ac5,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5577aaa62f8b9,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5577aa9ac2016	0
3005	Dead on Arrival	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2695	Sport	60	5.11d	4.75	This is one of the most unique and fascinating lines in its class and offers what may be the steepest and wildest ride you will ever encounter for a route of its grade. Begin on a nice, flat belay ledge and tackle the left-angling line of hand sized pockets leading up to a photo finish anchor clip. Your belayer may get vertigo trying to keep up with exactly which way you are climbing. Another line is bolted left of this route but no details are known at this time.	15	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/556b4343d078e,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fd4d043a3f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/523748f8c64db	0

2897	Pig's Nose	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2833	Sport	60	5.11b	2.5	This is the first route encountered when approaching from the right. Scramble up and ride a fat flake for a few moves then cut left. Stab big over the bulge then continue up on the sloping holds that Highlands is known for. Just before the chains you need to trust your instinct and go. It's big, don't worry.	1	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b59f6b412	0
2898	Sipping Scotch from a Shallow Grave	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2834	Sport	60	5.12a	3.8	This is the beginning of the Highlands 5.12 run. A well defined crux stab near the bottom serves as a great introduction to the cruxy nature of this wall.	2	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b5d0c2daa	0
2899	Knap of Orkney	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2835	Sport	60	5.12b	4	Begin on a low ledge. A slightly dirty start quickly opens up into challenging cruxes on shallow slopers, small edges, and tight tweakers. If the crux feels impossible try again on a cooler day.	3	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b5fd541f7	0
2900	Aye Fair to Middlin' (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2836	Sport	70	5.12b	0	This is the fourth line from the right on the main wall. Moderate climbing is quickly put to an end where an evil crux awaits mid-route. If you can break through then fun steep pulling will pump you to the chains. Equipped by Kipp Trummel.	4	31		0
2901	Dingwall	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2837	Sport	70	5.12b	4.63	This is probably the best line on the main wall. Begin in a crack and depending on your handjamming skills make an easy or tough move over a low roof. Move up with big pulls on good holds gunning for a crack where the games begin. Shift right over to the crack and follow it with delicate reach throughs and minimal feet to gain a shake. Cut back right to the crack and don't let up until you've made it through the obvious redpoint crux known to thwart many onsite attempts.	5	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379c38e09ea,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379c1f505c6,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536d9d5bab4d3	0
2902	Skinny Malinky Longlegs	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2838	Sport	65	5.12a	3	The FA isn't known for his route naming skills but he sure can drill them holes. Inconsistent but still a decent line. 5.10 climbing leads to a side-pulling sloper pop off of bad smears to a decent edge. Next dive into the abyss and come out at the chains.	6	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b491427c7	0
2903	Arthur's Seat	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2839	Trad	65	5.10a	1	Why? Because it's there. The obvious crack on the left side of the wall before the amphitheater.	7	16		0
2904	Wide Boys	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2840	Sport	70	5.12b	3.5	This is the last bolted line on the main wall before the amphitheater. A pop move off the ground will get you started on this quality line which will test your squeezers as well as your crimpers. A pump probably won't get you on this one but a couple of moves just might.	8	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379bac411ef,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379b8350ece,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b417e5fea,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a71f5ec7373,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a71ede82def	0
2905	Blood on the Thistle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2841	Sport	80	5.12d	4	The first of the four routes in the ampitheater. Climb to a roof at 25 feet and boulder over the roof making use of a sloping edge and a crack to reach good holds. From here move through good underclings to meet up with a blank section of the wall where subtle sloping pinches will let you past if held just right.	9	33	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b0e8abe37,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b0404a7e6	0
2906	Nessie	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2842	Sport	80	5.12c	4	Another gut busting roof start puts you onto high quality steep and sustained climbing with a couple of tough deadpoints. A steep start leads to a big undercling move to gain a good horizontal ledge in the roof. Traverse the ledge then reach over the lip for a decent hold to gain the face. Race up on edges and sloping pinches then make a launch to a crimp when the holds fizzle. Consistent crimping takes you to an upper crux where you can go big and dynamic or tiny and static depending on your taste.	10	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b1491ac19,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a720e1e14df,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a71f7b2b6bc	0
2907	Haggis Nugget	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2844	Sport	80	5.12b	3	Clip the first two bolts of Nessie then head straight over the roof to gain a hand ledge. Fire a deadpoint then climb the steep headwall on medium edges.	10	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553796bb1c46f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553796629ce8f	0
2908	Bodach	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2843	Sport	80	5.12d	4	On the left side of the amphitheater you will see a large flake in the roof. This and the next line climb up to and out this flake to begin. This route shifts right on bouldery moves to reach a good rest. Move up a bolt then make a full on launch to what couldn't be a bigger and more comfortable jug. Enjoyable 5.11 climbing takes you to the final two bolts where a tough clip and a sloper boulder problem guard the chains.	11	33	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b1a33c1b2,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7224a38d8e	0
2909	Tatty Boggler	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2845	Sport	60	5.11b	3.71	This is the first route on the shorter section of wall to the left of the amphitheater. Although it's one of the lower graded routes at the cliff it doesn't serve as a great warmup due to the strenuous moves.	13	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b35b040d8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7203468b2b	0
2910	Plaid Boys	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2846	Sport	50	5.12a	4.13	The next route left on the ledge routes. Excellent sustained climbing for the first 5 bolts makes for a good warmup. Go further if you feel good but prepare for a beating if you aren't feeling good on really bad holds.	14	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536d9e1ae24aa,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b2a4b3ff5	0
2911	William Wall Ace	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2847	Sport	50	5.12a	4	The third route from the left side of the wall and also one of the better lines. An awkward start leads to unique boulder problems separated by large plated jugs. A nice little pocket crux may become your close friend as you get acquainted with each other over multiple attempts. Be careful making the 4th clip where a fixed draw takes a little scare out.	15	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536d9f2ac23a1,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b303ba0c2	0

3404	Psychosomatic	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3854	Sport	80	5.12a	2.17	Like an Oreo, this climb is tough cookies at the beginning and end, with a soft creamy center. Hard bouldery movement is rewarded by a no-hands rest. Moderate climbing leads to a distinct crux pulling the roof. Get one last shake before taking on the moves from the final bolt to the chains.	17	30		0
3405	Pandemic	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2824	Sport	85	5.12b	3.79	Begin with a big pull over a low roof. Travel through a steep haul on big holds to meet up with a tough boulder problem just before a roof. This route is the only one on this wall that goes over the roof so unlike the others it doesn't stay dry in heavy rain. However, if you can hang onto wet jugs you should be fine.	18	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a07536979f2	0

3411	Ebola	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3236	Sport	70	5.12b	4.23	Begin atop the large boulder.

3412	Brachial Plexus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3215	Sport	80	5.11c	4.37	Begins behind the giant boulder.

Exit the comfort of the chimney with a tough gaston move and continue up the face through a stack of tricky moves with sparse feet culminating in a thrutch to a thank-God ear.

3053	Tittie Twister	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3109	Sport	60	5.12b	2.33	On the face to the right of the rockhouse is this steeper line of pockets in white sandstone. Although the movement is fun, the rock is fairly soft and poor for the majority of the route. Exiting the overhanging section onto the slab at the top requires some creative hold grabbing and tiny crimp cranking.	7	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/550e22ae1d0bb	0

3055	Re-Animator	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3110	Sport	80	5.11b	3.38	The bolted line left of the large rockhouse and wide crack. Begin right of an orange and black flake on a line of pockets which fade, along with the flake, after a small roof. Step back and forth as needed to stem the crack to the right as you discern a series of shallow dishes and the occasional jug. A medium sized cam may settle the nerves from the last bolt to the chains.	8	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408eea899955,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408ee72d59bd	0

Climb to a ledge to clip the first high bolt. Skirt a thin crack by using big ledges then step right onto the face where thin moves await. Negotiate a roof near the top on decent edges which may make you cringe when pullin on them.	11	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/533e11ddde000,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/533e11b254e08,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52bf72c70dddc	0

3359	Barking Dogmas	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2879	Sport	55	5.11c	4.06	Start with a gastony boulder problem which would serve as a great moderate at any bouldering area. Yank on big pockets with big pulls to reach a roof where a huge comfy jug awaits over the lip. Pull over on big holds then traverse right on finger slots with tough to see feet to reach the chains.	24	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55484bd29b02e,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d66a66258a,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d669234ef0,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d64c2f0775,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5449ab1f193e2,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52bf7898b3f70,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52bf77762148b	0

3362	The Suffering	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2882	Sport	65	5.12b	4.24	This and the next line will serve the Red River endurance climber a little better but still require some oomph at times. A fingery start will take you to a fun swim through a sea of holds up the steep wall. A nice finger slot stab mid-route is the first obstacle. The second comes going for the chains where heel hooking skills could take a lot of the sting out.	27	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55484c11a9a31,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d675b006f7,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6729f0658,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52bf79734d8fa,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52be3d214159c	0

An awkward start leads to super steep climbing on sloping holds and shallow pockets. A well needed rest near the top will prepare you for the sustained run to the chains.	28	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55484c3903068,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d66625a403,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d65a436dcb,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6569de934,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d65094ae27,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5449abc263ff9,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536708b4f2960,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52bf79ad0111f	0

Climb the slab and exit as quickly as possible onto gargantuan grips beneath the steep side of the arch. Unclip your slab bolts to reduce drag then launch into a wild dance through nearly horizontal cave climbing. When you think it can't get any steeper a body length, flat roof with huge incut jugs guards the most difficult move on the route, a hard crank into the chain pod. This route is insane but unfortunately some may be hesitant to yank on the jugs.

3262	Sloppy Seconds	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2745	Sport	80	5.11a	4	A tricky and thin lower section leads to a great arete run on big holds.

Enjoyable plate climbing abruptly ends near the top where the moves get serious. You can't blame this one on the pump. It's recommended to either unclip or put a long draw on the third bolt.	18	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b714cb5ca,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b6e1e8d31,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b6a2dff06	0

Tweaky moves on small edges and shallow pockets lead to a steeper and more relaxed, though slightly odd, finish.	2	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525c8e7f6098b	0
3316	Bon Voyage	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3237	Sport	55	5.11d	3.87	Marked by glue-in bolts.

3317	Return of the Mohan	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2760	Sport	55	5.11d	4.26	The premier line of the area. The first ascentionist stated it was his best line since Tuskan Raider at Darkside. Fingery climbing on solid rock with just the right amount of holds to keep the grade moderate and the moves remarkable.	4	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5551623700fad,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6917e955c,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d68f87d313,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d68e039ca4,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5449a523016c4,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525c8fd60b6f0	0
3318	Rising Hegemon	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2761	Sport	65	5.11b	3.03	Although not the quality of its neighbors, this line serves as a fun warm up for the area. Begin with a few bolts of slightly friable rock to reach better stone above.	5	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5428cfce43e9a	0
3319	BCL	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3526	Sport	50	5.11a	2.96	Start 10 ft right of Hammer Time.

3320	Hammer Time	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2762	Sport	70	5.11b	4.27	Just right of a flake leading to a thin seam begins this line. It is marked by a large nose flake feature near the top. A bit of creativity will gain you a no-hands rest here, which you may need for the crux run for the chains. A nearly unavoidable encounter with a big, scary hold awaits at the end.	6	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d685dbd63f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d684401289,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525e9befb1541,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525c8f1a3accf	0
3321	Can't Touch This	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3324	Sport	70	5.12b	3.43	Tackle a low boulder problem that will test your lock off strength as you reach for a high crimp and shorties may find that they can't touch this. Regain your composure and finish the route up on a series of fun yet pumpy roof pulls.	6	31	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5540c394cb39a,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5540c38091cde	0
3322	Fodiqua	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3005	Sport	80	5.9	3.47	This line takes on the slab in the water streak. Rumor has it this will still be dirty in 3014. Remember though, dirt does not a bad route make.	7	12		0
3323	Malignant	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2763	Sport	90	5.11a	3.21	What it lacks in cleanliness it makes up for with length. Thin edges lead to a small roof with a jug where you will probably be for awhile as you scope for holds above. Eventually you will realize there really aren't many so you should probably just quit wasting time and try something.	8	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/546d426b47210,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5428cf4c7055e	0

3325	Sundial	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2698	Sport	80	5.11a	4.04	A magnificent face climb. Scramble to the top of the pillar with stemming and face holds to begin. Step out onto the face when ready for high quality and technical face climbing. The final section climbs the crack to the right of the last bolt. Clipping is possible with a good side-pull in the crack.	10	23	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d68b77d6c8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6820f40f8,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6809599d4,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/531fcb279b6e8	0
3326	Dirty Habit	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2697	Sport	85	5.10d	3.32	This line begins just right of the blunt arete near the detached pillar. Due to the runoff expect a layer of dirt but don't let it chase you off! The holds are decent and the movement is great so it can still be a fun ride for a select few.	11	19	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55077f2525529	0
3327	Cam I Have Another?	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3893	Trad	55	5.8	0	Left of Dirty Habit. This face crack has a tree growing out of the middle.

3328	Dancing Queen	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3021	Sport	60	5.10b	2.81	Left of Dirty Habit is a pair of lines. This climbs the slab with a low crux. Dirty at this time but as with most lines it may clean up to be a decent line given the solidity of the rock.	12	17	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55077b78df863	0
3329	Linny Lu	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3020	Sport	55	5.10a	2.48	Left of Dancing Queen is another low-angle line that will probably clean up well with age.	13	16	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55077b3e91b72	0
3188	The Unfriender	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3273	Sport	70	5.12c	3.5	A faint trail runs from the road up to Vine Wall meeting the cliff near a long, flat log. This route is left of where the trail meets the wall and begins with an impossible looking first couple of moves. After the start expect great 5.11 face climbing.	1	32	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c9935b45f1f,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c6eecaa8d46	0
3189	Honey Barbecue	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3432	Sport	110	5.12b	4	Quality sustained face climbing at the bottom leads to a big move before the roof and an easy top out section. Continue to the top on excellent mid-11 face and slab, belay to make it 2 pitches, or descend from here. If linking into one pitch, back-cleaning or extending the 5th bolt (at the dynamic move before the roof) will greatly reduce rope drag. Probably a good idea to pull the rope and descend from the midway anchor if linking both pitches with a 60-meter rope.	1	31		0
3190	Poison S	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3274	Sport	50	5.11d	4	Right of a long, flat boulder is this relentless finger burning face climb which will challenge your abilities with shallow pockets, poor feet, and powerful crimping. A steep ending delivers the crux just when you think you have a chance.	2	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c992f819a4a	0
3191	Bottle Shock	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3275	Sport	40	5.11d	3.5	Begin in front of a boulder with a bad left pocket and a good right if you can reach. Race through a series of bad crimps with even worse feet to a relief jug. When the tips cool down fire to the ledge. Stick clipping the second bolt is recommended.	3	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c992a8ddefc	0
3192	Undici	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3276	Sport	80	5.11b	2.4	Around the corner from the vertical wall bordering the trail is a dirty face right of the arete. Pay your dues to reach the upper headwall which looks pretty good from the ground.	4	24	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c99240aef07	0
3193	Outrunner	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3277	Sport	80	5.11d	0	This is currently the first line on the main overhanging section of Vine Wall. Find a path through the vines to reach it. The first 3/4 of this line is not for the faint of heart but the rock quality improves for the final steep headwall. Equipped by Rob McFall in 2003.	5	26		0
3194	Forerunner	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3278	Sport	80	5.11d	0	20 feet right of previous line, left of a small corner, is another line of similar quality. If you liked Outrunner, this one's for you.	6	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a076445e3,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a052282e6,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c991bc14b36	0
3195	Shogun	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3279	Sport	80	5.11d	0	Begin right of a corner and clip a high first bolt by scrambling up to a 6 foot ledge. 60 feet of terrifying climbing on sandy and fragile rock leads to a steep headwall with long reaches on deep pockets. Ledge fall potential going to the 2nd bolt so it is recommended to hang on the first bolt and stick clip it.	7	26	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c99144efa75	0
3196	Sweet Berry Wine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3319	Sport	80	5.11c	2.67	Another long adventure up Vine Wall. Consistent climbing trends from left to right with a no-hands at the 4th.	8	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5531a0cf1f883	0
3197	De Vine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3280	Sport	85	5.12a	4	If you can reach it without getting swallowed up by the ground, there's another route further down the wall. Large but friable holds improve in quality as the line reaches a steep, upper corner of sorts. Begins with a first bolt on the immediate left side of a corner.	9	30	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c993d2d3031	0
3198	Highway to Hell	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3283	Sport	100	5.13a	4	Paw through ivy to gain a ledge where this route begins. A difficult beginning with poor feet eases up to a short but pumpy run to a sandy ledge where an initial set of anchors are located. Bail here for 5.11c or continue up through a section of extreme choss and sand to reach the beginning of an insanely good pumpfest that makes up for all the low quality rock surrounding it. Equipped by Kevin Cox and Mike Wheatley. The upper pitch of this route is well worth the trip.	10	37	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a0c4588dd,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a0b086df2	0
3199	Citizen Four	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3353	Sport	110	Unknown	0	Begin just right of Highway to Hell. A bouldery start opens up to larger holds to reach an overhanging flake. Exit the flake to tackle a 60 degree roof which ends with a runout on deep slots to the chains. Equipped by Ray Ellington.	10	9999		0
3200	The M & M Goblin (Open Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3516	Sport	100	5.13	0	20 feet right of Citizen Four. Begins on a cruxy slab. Easy climbing leads to a no hands rest before going steep on a mix of holds.	10	36		0
3201	Booyah (Open Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3281	Sport	95	5.14	5	50 feet of vertical climbing brings you to a no hands rest. Don't be deceived. Getting to the third bolt is brutal. From the rest the wall goes steep. Bring your 70 meter rope.	11	43	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c6fe7b33b5a	0

3463	Skin Suit	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3744	Sport	35	5.11c	2.5	A reach will help you on this one. Sparse feet in the crux and despite its height it may still pump you.	5	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bc8c4cce0fb4	0
3464	Summer School	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3745	Sport	60	5.10c	3.83	One of the easier routes in the area but still not a great warmup due to the fingery moves down low.

3466	Firestarter	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3747	Sport	70	5.11c	4.5	A dirty start gets you to a flake where the climbing begins. A long reach crux followed by a deadpoint stab leads to enjoyable and pumpy climbing on big holds. The anchors are straight up, not out left.	8	25	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bc8c6ffb017e,https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5bc8838c8b1eb	0
