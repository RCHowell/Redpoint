23	Keys in the Back of a Cadillac	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3488	Trad	140	5.11d	3	Park as for grays wall (currently park right before the ''bump" sign) hike uphill slightly to the left until you come across a 20ft dihedral capped by a roof. Climb the dihedral and traverse the roof to a ledge (a bit dirty at the moment but the more traffic the cleaner it becomes) Pitch 2: Wide crack all the way too the right on the ledge. Climb on crappy quality rock for about 30 feet to another ledge. Pitch 3: This is the money pitch! Directly above pitch 2 is a beautiful dihedral with a thin fingers crack leading to a 12 foot roof which opens to hand/fist size and has some fun gymnastical moves then leads back to some face climbing to another ledge. Here i recommend breaking it into a fourth pitch to reduce rope drag for the last 20 feet to the top.	5	26

There are two dihedrals in this section of cliff, and Rubus Fruticosus is the one on the right uphill from Trinket Man. The first pitch climbs up a fun chimney system to your choice of two ledges to belay from. The second pitch continues up the steep, intimidating dihedral, but traverses right to a topout and is easier than it appears. This could be done as one long pitch if you take great care with rope drag. Enjoy some blackberries along the way. Morning shade.	21	10

Climb the first pitch of Rubus Fruticosus to the higher of the two ledge belays. The second pitch traverses right along a good horizontal to pick up the gently overhanging splitter crack. When the crack ends, move left to a jug and a crack that takes a small cam or bomber stopper, then top it out. Enjoy the good rock, moves, protection, and exposure.

This adventure route gifts one with an amazing view of Long Wall and the walls across the river! Make a temporary anchor to bring up a second; find the rap station on another tree.	40	10	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59e63ba6cfe34
157	Texas Tea	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1284	Trad	60	5.8+	3.83	If you are just going to do this, or the next couple of routes, it is best to locate a direct approach from the road. Otherwise, hike about 250 yards right from the previous route to a large buttress. This route ascends a nice looking black dihedral on the buttress.	41	10	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59e63e4b164d3
158	Vitruvian Moon	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3538	Trad	85	5.10d	4	From Texas Tea follow the cliff to the right, ducking under a low roof. About half way to Block and Tackle look up at a thin crack in a wide dihedral on a ledge, which is under an S-shaped crack opening into an offwidth. This line was ignored until 2017 probably due to the apparent lack of protection for 25 feet, but has a small pocket (BD 0.2) and a horizontal (BD 0.75) for openers, with good protection the rest of the way. Reserve a BD 3 or BD 6 for the OW bottom, and a BD 5 for the OW. The OW ends at a beautiful, circular hueco (diameter of about 2.5 meters) in which one can comfortably Vitruvian Man stand. With finger-sized pieces, protect the hueco and top out at a stout evergreen.	41	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59e63fa41ba4c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59e637c12f0cb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59e63214dbce3

160	Sugar Daddy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1286	Trad	90	5.9-	0	Walk 300 feet right from Block and Tackle to another butress. This route ascends a dihedral on this butress. Climb the dihedral to a ledge then take a handcrack to the ending ledge.	43	11	
161	Sunset	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2567	Trad	90	5.8+	4	At Long Wall, walk far to the right. Go past Big Country. Go past The Snatch and Gladuator. Continue past Texas Tea and Block and Tackle. Go past Sugar Daddy, wherever it is. Continue along the wall through some rhodos. A ledge about ten feet high will appear to your left. Continue along this ledge through some more rhodos. Pass a few gulleys that head up to the ledge. When you can see a flake feature above the ledge and a gulley that will allow you to access the ledge, scramble up and then to the left. This route starts as a tight hands splitter and then quickly becomes a flake. Climb up the flake, reaching around it frequently for a ridiculous number of perfect, hidden handholds. Brave the insecure mantle to gain a large ledge and belay trees, as well as a perfect view of Auxier Ridge, Courthouse Rock, and the rest of Long Wall. If you timed it right, enjoy the sunset over Auxier Ridge. The FAs were probably some cool old people long ago, but possibly Dan Beck and Nate Butcher in 2012.	44	10	
201	Tough Enough	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1258	Trad	50	5.10b	4	Walk left from The Poacher for about 15 minutes. Eventually you will spot this nice looking handcrack.

Stem past the funky opening, then past a tree, into a very fun, mostly hands, splitter. Finish with steep techy jamming to a bit of chossy soft rock. Topout, and find a way down	4	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/quality-new.jpg

208	Wide Pride	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=873	Trad	55	5.10c	4.88	Park in the same area as for Purple Valley. The road is blocked by metal pylons but continues on as a 4-wheel drive road. Hike past the pylons and over a mound of dirt. Continue in the same direction as the road making use of a trail on your right to avoid crossing the stream. Cross the stream when you have to and pick up the trail again. Don't head left up Amos Creek as you do for the approach to Quality Crack. Instead, cross the stream again and continue on the road/trail. Cross the stream 2 more times. About 500 feet after you cross the stream a fourth time, head off the trail to the left and cross the stream again. Wander up the hill near a drainage and past some boulders up a little higher. Eventually you'll see the cliff. You'll probably end up meeting the cliff about 600 feet left of Wide Pride. Hike to the right until you see the obvious wide splitter crack hidden behind a tree.	8	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/51bb1977630fd,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/widepride.jpg
209	Key Pebble	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1266	Trad	75	5.9	3	Hike right from Wide Pride along the cliffline for about 300 yards. This is the perfect (but mossy) handcrack that cuts to the left into an offwidthy thing up top. Would be beautiful if someone took the time to clean all the moss out of the crack. It makes good cushioning for your handjams, though.	9	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/51bb17d88a4d5

Hike straight up the hill to this beautiful orange southwest-facing wall (afternoon sun). You can also shwack left from the previous three routes at this crag, but it sucks big time. This route is the obvious dihedral on the right side of the orange wall. Fingers to a short squeeze to perfect hands that go on forever followed by an exciting slab finish... a small-medium cam or two protects this part but look carefully. This one is up there with Rock Wars and Jim's Dihedral as far as quality goes.	4	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/546690929d9a0

502	Treason at the Watchtower	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2172	Trad	155	5.9	2.67	This route is located on a bluff near Dunkan Rock. Located across the street from Fortress and Phantasia is this open corner of towering rock. From the road you should be able to identify a large pine tree on the left hand side of the cliff that is about 30 feet from the top. This is the belay station for the final pitch of this route.To reach, follow directions for Dunkan Rock, but direct yourself one bluff south of Dunkan. Upon arriving at the bluff, walk around the left side until you spot a pair of cracks about 50 feet up. This is the start of the second pitch. Keep walking around left (north) side of bluff another 50 feet until you can scramble up a ramp that leads to your right. This begins the first pitch, which consists of a thin chimney to a large ledge (25 feet, 5.6). Pitch two starts in the left crack of the pair you can see from the ground and goes over a bulge, up a hand crack to a no hands rest in an alcove. Place pro in the top of the alcove, down climb a bit and traverse ten feet right to the adjacent crack the bottom of which has a tree. Build a hanging belay ten-twenty feet up the adjacent crack to protect you second from a potential pendulum (50 feet, 5.Cool. Pitch three, pull a short roof off bomber hand jams, trudge some sludge up and right to an easy, but wildly exposed, mantle. Set up a belay off the big pine tree (50 feet, 5.Cool.

668	Tower of Power	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=400	Trad	155	5.10c	5	''Larry Day is still alive also! Apologies in advance for the shameless promotion of my own route, but Tower of Power has a somewhat significant roof. In fact it is pretty cool, not your typical RRG type roof but more of a Gunks kind of problem. Geezer, it really shouldnt be too hard to spot. Directly above the crack that forms the first pitch you will see a flake that is somewhat detached from the roof above. Haul your ass up on to that flake and sit astride it in a kind of mambo? stance. You know what I mean, leaning way back, cause the roof will be right in your face. Reach way out to the lip and you will find a great hold, and best of all a bomber tricam (1.5 or maybe a 2) placement in a vertical crack (slotted, not cammed). Screw up your courage, pull the roof, and KEEP YOUR %#^ TOGETHER because its kinda run out on 5.10 face above. Its way exhilarating, and not nearly so hard as Insanity Ceiling. Together with the stupendous first pitch it is truly one of the best old school climbs in the gorge. I am really not trying to sandbag anyone. The first pitch starts out somewhat ugly and strange, then becomes beautiful beyond belief. Then there is the matter of the runout above the roof. Definitely a place where only the big boys and girls should play.

The reward for making it this far is an enjoyable Red-Riveresque romp on large holds up a more overhanging and pumpy section of the wall.	26	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/51e32b9a3178c

Will be updated at some point with a belay anchor and a couple bolts on the unprotectable top half (5.4). In the meantime, this gaping maw stays true to its name... don't climb this expecting much protection up in there, maybe the largest big bro all tipped out at best. AKA Hotdog in a Hallway.	35	4

Begin under a roof and yard out on jugs to gain the overhanging face. Climb through long moves on good holds to a well defined crux. Keep it together for the rest of the route because it ain't over.	6	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5443bee9b17cb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5443beb44db31,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4c16623b702cd,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/469d2145b5554,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/469d2133a28cb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4439a813adafb
1767	Spread Eagle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2796	Trad	90	5.11a	4	The intimidating corner tucked in to the right of Belly offers up some of the craziest moves and most bizarre positions in the Red. Burl out the crux start in the left chimney/crack, then shimmy up the offwidth and out the hanging chimney system, clipping the Dirty Girl anchor if you are light on big cams. Save a finger sized piece or two for the exit. The right start would would probably bump this down into the 5.10 range, but expect some loose rock. Bring several large cams in the BD 5-6 range, and a decent amount of everything else. Belay or lower from the ledge anchor for the slab sport route right of Dirty Girl.	6	23

Ascends the left side of giant hueco on friable looking but solid rock before angling gently up to the right through side pulls, underclings, crimps, pinches and pockets to a definitive crux after which the pace slows to a cautious finish.

After roughly 300 feet you will come to this obvious line that has an old oil pipeline coming down from the top of the cliff and going under a small natural bridge / rock arch. To the left of the pipe is a muddy flake, and to the right a clean handcrack. Take the handcrack up, traverse under the arch, and then climb up and onto the arch.

Before you come to Sorostitute, you'll come to some small boulders and see a wall with a large roof at mid-height and this line.	32	31	
1512	Sorostitute	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1528	Trad	50	5.7	0	300ft. right of Marriage Counseling is an obvious dihedral in the back of the ampitheater. Climb the dihedral to a sandy ledge. Rap from fixed gear. Dirtier than she looks.	33	6

This is the left of the two lines and begins with sloping moves then kicks back midway for the steeps the Red is known for.	34	25	
1514	Good Gravy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2352	Sport	55	5.10b	3.67	Just right of Chucklehead is an another great line on solid stone. Holds so good you'll think you're in the gym.	35	17	
1296	Three Stooges	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3552	Sport	90	5.10c	2.78	This route is currently the furthest left route at the Chocolate Factory and starts about 50 feet left of For Your Health. Climb up several bolts on a pocketed face and then work your way through a couple of ledges to where the good climbing begins. Surmount a bulge and don't get suckered into picking the wrong direction. Continue on slightly overhanging good rock offering some interesting movement.	0	18	
1297	For Your Health	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2641	Sport	90	5.11a	3.2	This is currently the leftmost line at Chocolate Factory.

This route can be found on the wall just left of a wide crack. Climb up to a small ledge to reach the meat of the line which consists of steep jug pulling reminiscent of the classic Twinkie at Phantasia.	2	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50b7b2f1546d9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50a9dde451987

1300	Shootin' Hot Hugs	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2430	Sport	70	5.12a	3.73	Routes 1-16 are best reached by following the first trail on the left off of the main trail. The trail heads up and right to meet up with the cliff near this route. Look for bolts on a nice looking golden wall beginning above a 15 foot high ledge.	4	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e1b33c1782

1303	R. Kelly Ethics	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2506	Trad	120	5.10c	3	To the right of EGBG, burl hard off the ledge and over the low roof. The finger-size gear at the roof is bomber, but quickly degrades in the next 10 ft. Ascend up and left around the arete. About 1/3 of the line overlaps with EGBG which veers left to its anchors. Stay trad, climbing straight up to top out through a techy offwidth (#4 + #5 BD). Belay your second from a tree. There is decking potential for the second at the ledge-roof start; the arete eats rope; and the top-rope sharply exalts the grade of the start. Drop the rope to the start of EGBG for the second. Rap off a tree (~7 m) down to the anchors of EGBG then to the ground.	7	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/507c59364de1d
1304	Icebreaker	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2509	Sport	85	5.12a	4.06	Just left of Eternal Fire is this high-quality climb at a comparatively moderate grade. Traverse the lip of the roof on heel hooks to gain the crux blunt arete followed by spectacular technical face climbing to the top of the wall.Get a spot and keep the rope slack for the first couple of moves, or just go old-school hang the first draw while climbing. The crux moves moving right at the third bolt are 12a for the reach- impaired.	8	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50869479ae3f0
1305	Eternal Fire	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2350	Sport	70	5.13c	5	50 feet right of Shootin' Hot Hugs is a gorgeous orange wall hosting two well sought after difficult lines.

1306	Cat's Demise	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2309	Sport	70	5.13b	4.86	Just right of Eternal Fire is another power sapper with easier opening moves but a tougher finish. Race past moderately steep pinches and slopers to a much needed rest before the last bolt. Shove a leg in, get everything back, then pick your poison. If you've got your crimpers trained up then reach straight up for a tiny right hand seam and pull hard on it to reach a high crimp then bust for the ledge. If you've logged some time on the slopes then instead of heading straight up, move left from the rest on insane pinches and slopers to reach the anchor ledge. Either way is a tough boulder problem. Bring a bail biner. You'll need it.	10	38	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564c01ef57aa8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564c0199e11b7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e1bd2924a4

1312	Bleak December	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2403	Sport	55	5.12b	2.87	Walk right from Cat's Demise about 100 feet to locate six challenging crimp lines.This is line directly left of Dainty Butterfly and begins with a left arching crack. Follow the crack until it fades then move up into some difficult cranking on small edges. The ending shares some personality with the Butterfly to the right.	16	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f9de717214b3,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4eeab635a7136

Climb the crack then scoot right onto the face for a rest for a couple of moves to reach the final decent rest before the showdown. Shift left back onto the face for the second half of the route which gets more difficult with each bolt run, until the holds diminish just in time for the finish.	17	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f9de6d545c89

This is left line and falls into the category of ''It may clean up and get better".	21	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e1d63531d1
1318	Sunday Night Cockfights	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2438	Sport	55	5.11b	3.21	Just right of the previous line is this interesting ride. Climb through a low crux then continue up the face using small pockets and sidepulls to reach a height dependent move just before the chains. Although it looks kind of like the route to the left it is of much better quality.	22	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e1d8d79cab

1322	Butane Junky	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2444	Sport	75	5.12a	4	This slab line will probably shut you down and make you cry. Enjoy.	26	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50020f1257132
1323	Wonkaholic	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2345	Sport	55	5.10a	3.1	Just around the corner from Butane Junky is this interesting moderate. Climb through 4 bolts of large plates to reach a ledge where the holds get smaller and tougher to reach. If you know how to fistjam the end may be a little easier for you.	27	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8e1ea5ed11c

Scramble up and look for the next crack system which appears to be a great line at first glance but apparently doesn't climb as well. There is no anchor so figure out a way down.	35	15	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/500210e6ce58f

1333	Wobbler	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2272	Sport	55	5.11d	3.84	As the approach trail nears the cliff look for an old logging road on the left. Follow the road/trail for about 100 yards until it turns uphill and ends at a section of the cliff containing some bolted lines. This is the first on the left. Begin with a few big moves then race through sequential pockets and small crimps with no good rest to be had. Pull a small roof to gain the chains and throw a huge wobbler if you fall at this point because you have to do it all over again.	37	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ad665e476123,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4ac95d564f34d,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4aaeea1a6469f

Start with the comfort of a pair of good holds which quickly diminish to relentless crimping up the slightly overhanging face. Grab a good shake on a decent set of slots then crimp even harder through the obvious crux near the top. As with Wobbler, don't blow it going for the chains.	38	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4aaeea4b55de3

Climb moderate rock to reach an alcove where you will want to get the best protection you can. Pull out into the fingercrack and attempt to balance the desire to send with the desire to protect yourself. If you survive the crack, traverse right then continue up on face holds with decent protection.	40	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/50021257c0490

This is the left line and is a must do. Climb up a short, easy slab section to reach the overhang. Pop over to a large reinforced jug feature which may possibly be crowbarred off in the future. Reach hard for slopers, then leave the safety of the jugs for some of the best moves and holds the Red has to offer. While recovering after the overhang switch gears and make a difficult move to gain the vertical wall then relax to the chains.	42	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5002132099454,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4b09a4bd288f3

1345	Sugar Rush	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2267	Sport	65	5.10a	2.94	This and the following two routes are right of Down the Rabbit Hole but it's best to walk back down to the old logging road and head back toward the fork near the top of the main trail. Look for a large boulder on your left with a trail bordering the left side. Head shortly uphill to meet up with these routes. This is the first on the left. Positive holds lead to a ''made for side-pulling" move that leads you to briefly thinner terrain and a rail.Continue up to be rewarded with a few true slab moves. Go left, go right, go straight up, just go and don't forget to step up after clipping the chains for a good view behind you.	49	16	
1346	Augustus Gloop	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2268	Sport	60	5.9	2.87	Right of Sugar Rush. Start on large ledges or traverse in from the right, then transition to water grooves and small edges to a stance at a horizontal band halfway up. Make a move to the next bolt then enjoy larger features to the anchors.	50	12	
1347	Chocolate River	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2256	Sport	50	5.9	2.88	Just right of Augustus Gloop. Begin on a reachy mantel start and then climb a technical slabby face to a finish over a bulge.	51	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4a2f1a0cdd152
1348	Meh	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2566	Mixed	50	5.9+	2.25	This is the mixed climb directly to the right of Chocolate River. An awkward start leads to some decent climbing and an awkward, bouldery finish.	52	13

1351	Squirrelworker	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2454	Sport	70	5.11a	3.3	This and the following three routes are around the corner to the right of the previous slab lines. If you followed the main trail up to the cliff instead of taking the left branch up to Cat's Demise then continue straight past the obvious trail on the left near the top of the trail to the next trail on the left which leads directly up to these routes. Take the next trail on the left which leads straight up to a vertical wall containing several bolted lines. This is the leftmost line and begins with some bulge wrestling to reach the less demanding face above.	55	23	
1352	Peaches and Cream	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2251	Trad	60	5.10b	3.8	As the approach trail nears the cliff, continue past the logging road that leads left to Wobbler then take the next trail on the left which leads straight up to a vertical wall containing several bolted lines. This crack is just left of J-Rat's Back and starts with a low roof.	56	17	
1353	J Rat's Back	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2163	Sport	70	5.12a	3.98	This is the second bolted line from the left side of the wall and easily the best on this section of the wall. Climb slotted pockets to reach a distinct crux section after clipping the fourth bolt. Continue up to a short overhanging pockets section just before the chains.	57	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4be18c6769d52,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/48e218ad428a5

1357	Willy Wonka	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2160	Sport	60	5.11a	3.44	This slab line can be found 50 feet right of the previous lines. Belay from the low spot, but start the route from atop the boulder. Several distinct cruxes will challenge slab climbers, and make jug haulers whine and complain.	61	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5147a54e9930c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5147a4e023b8a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/48e133cdec00b

1360	The Andy Man Can	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2133	Trad	65	5.10d	4.29	Walk right from Willy Wonka to locate this crack situated up and left above a large ledge. Continue through the thin hands crack in the steep dihedral to a sit-down rest in a large hueco. From the hueco, continue up an offwidth making use of good face holds to the top.	64	19	
1361	Scarlet Scorchdropper	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2415	Sport	60	5.11c	4.35	Begin on the same ledge as Andy Man Can and left of Veruca Salt. Balancey and technical face climbing with some exciting layback moves. May feel pretty stiff for the grade.	65	25

1363	The Giant Peach	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2642	Sport	75	5.11b	3.44	The tall orange face between Glass Elevator and Veruca Salt. Crimp up to the ledge, take a nap, then launch up the pumpy headwall. Extend or back-clean the first bolt off the ledge to minimize rope drag on the upper wall.	67	24	
1364	The Glass Elevator	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2132	Sport	65	5.10d	3.53	50 feet right of Veruca Salt is a featured wall hosting four bolted lines.

1365	Oompa	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2151	Sport	55	5.10a	3.84	Next line right of Glass Elevator. Match and cross through an excellent line of sequential pockets and edges.

1370	Pure Imagination	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2201	Sport	75	5.14c	4	Begin just right of Charlie on the large boulder. Johnathan's excellent description of the moves follows: ''After some easy initial climbing, the route fires directly into a very serious boulder problem on thin, very sharp edges, finishing with a wild, all-points-off sideways dyno to a resting jug. From here the route carries on with difficult lock-offs on crimps and pockets to surprisingly frequent, albeit worsening rests. Towards the top lies the a longest section of uninterrupted hard climbing that finishes with a reachy, shouldery lock-off (redpoint crux). There is a solid rest at the final bolt before you climb a series of pockets and long moves guarding the chains." If that's not enough beta for you then search for the many videos on the tubes.

2087	Crimps and Bloods	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2647	Sport	95	5.12a	3.3	Currently the longest route on the wall, this lengthy crimp fest begins 10 feet left of Hakuna Matata.

About 40 feet left of the approach trail is an attractive plated face with an alcove about 60 feet up. Climb up to the alcove, take a deep breath, then brave the exposed arete and steep face to the anchors. The famous ''flexi-hold" finally broke, making for a tough crux clip.	6	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4753f693478d3,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/46a3f286ce82c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/46a3f279d916b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/breakfastburrito.jpg

This route is the first line encountered and begins just right of a crack. Climb finger pockets to a ego busting crux near the third bolt. Pull onto the overhanging face and bust through several tough moves which could quite possibly destroy the forearms. Take advantage of any shakes you can get as you approach the final awkward anchor clip.	8	31	
2097	Check Your Grip	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=842	Sport	80	5.12a	4.46	This route starts about 10 feet right of Whipper Snapper.

From the ledge, make a scary clip then smack right to reach your friend for the next few bolts, Mr. Fat Flake. Dig and squeeze while slapping for chalk spots.

2114	The Nothing	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=852	Sport	90	5.14a	3	This route begins by climbing a faint crack system about 15 feet right of the previous route. A gimme 5.14 for those who spent the winter in Hueco. Hopefully that'll help give it some love. Remember though, Dave doesn't think it's 5.14. Will that detract the chasers? Let the games begin.	23	44	
2115	The Galaxy (project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2216	Sport	0	Unknown	0	This line is currently being bolted. Follows the fat flake 30 feet right of The Nothing.

Bust through the first boulder problem to reach a ledge. Exit when ready then rage through 3 more bolts of insanity, complete with a Madness-like sloping beach move. Milk a recovery jug for all it's got then bust another boulder problem and dive for the toilet seat. One more long move gets you to the chains where you can be glad everything fell into place just right.	26	39	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408b7e6c388d,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408b7da1ff9e

Time will tell.	27	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4fd936e278289,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4fd936a0812ba

2000	Transworld Depravity	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1079	Sport	110	5.14a	5	Transworld Depravity starts from the ground about 15 feet to the left of BOHICA, on the far left side of the Madness cave. It is pre-equipped with permanent draws except on the dogging bolts. There is a long draw on the first bolt to avoid rope drag and to keep the belayer from swinging off the belay stance when the leader falls, but climbers should stick clip a normal draw for the opening moves to keep from hitting the ground if something breaks. Though the route is roughly 110 feet long, there is no problem getting down from the anchor with a 70 meter rope. It is about 12c for the first 60 feet up to a good rest, and then there is a bouldery move to some sustained hard climbing, up to another tough move. After that it is about 13a to the top, but pretty good rests.	28	44	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564c03936dd24,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4d7ea66fe83e7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/48ebf782c3639

1739	The 101st	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2890	Sport	45	5.12d	2.5	Calling all boulderers! The short and powerful arete starting on the high ledge left of Skyliner. Two bolts of easy climbing leads to a pronounced and sharp boulder problem. Recover on a jug then enjoy easier, but sequential, run to the top on pockets and an arete.	7	33	
1740	The Centurion	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2891	Sport	65	5.12a	5	If you bolt 99 routes in the Red your prize is apparently a marvelous chunk of stone with subtle pinches and stellar movement. Call this the 5.12 version of Golden Boy. Begins atop a block that has some challenges itself to get on top of. Happy 100th route Trummel!	8	30	
1741	Gran Tourismo	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2892	Sport	70	5.10c	3.88	In the middle of the wall is an obvious prowl with a low roof marked by a wooden ladder to assist in staying clean at the start. Climb the ladder then make a sketchy exit onto the arete where nice big horizontals will lead you to a choss grovel for the chains.	9	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534bfa5f5fb8a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5314eb2be8b9a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52ee617321103
1742	Swarm	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2895	Sport	50	5.12b	0	On the main wall there is a group of lines together ranging from vertical to slightly overhanging. These are before the trail dips down to where Gran Tourismo is. This is the rightmost line.	10	31	
1743	The Plague	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2896	Sport	50	5.11a	3	Left of Swarm. Slightly pumpy pulling to a make or break at the chains.	11	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534bfac553457
1744	Wild Kingdom	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2897	Sport	60	5.12a	3	Left of The Plague and not as good as it looks.	12	30	
1745	They're Watching	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2898	Sport	60	5.11c	3.67	They're watching you from the woods. Do you see them? They are laughing as you scramble on sloping sandy holds to clip the chains on what you thought would be a great warmup.	13	25	
1746	Wasabi (project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2899	Sport	60	Unknown	0	Last line on the left for this group of routes in the middle of the wall. Just left of They're Watching. Equipped by Kipp Trummel.	14	9999	
1747	Gymkhana	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2900	Sport	70	5.11b	3	This line takes on the steep and well featured portion of the wall marked by a flat roof near the top. Very green near the beginning but also steep with big holds. How desperate are you for that pump? The finish may make it worth your while.	15	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534bff2a05778
1748	Leaning Tower	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2901	Sport	70	5.12a	2.5	A pair of lines ascend the overhanging tower left of Gymkhana. This is the right route and the better of the two. Although friable and dirty it lends some decent movement and a wicked pump for the out of shape forearms.	16	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534c0080c9418
1749	Cayenne	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2902	Sport	70	5.11b	2.5	The left route on the tower.	17	24

1522	Butterfly Gangbang	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1472	Trad	80	5.8+	1.5	Just before going through the arch to reach the main sport routes of Purgatory, walk left 50ft. to find the next three lines. This is the left leaning flake that starts as a handcrack and has a tree 50ft. up on a ledge. Try not to let the butterflies violate you as you grovel up the widening handcrack.	1	10	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399bdd669667
1523	Looking Through the Devil's Window	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1471	Trad	40	5.6	2.89	This wide, left leaning ramp up a green face begins 30ft. left of Butterfly Gangbang.

Boulder up to a ledge, then layback up and around the first roof to a no hands rest in a large hueco. Continue to a higher ledge and belay. Tackle the surprisingly short second roof and top out.	3	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399be0f16668
1525	Skunk love	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1594	Sport	65	5.11b	4.54	Another tough slab line right of Stirrin' the Grits. This one is actually doable for non-slab masters.	4	24	
1526	Stirrin' the Grits	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2386	Sport	65	5.11c	3.33	Just left of Skunk Love lies this slab on solid stone. Bring out your inner trad game for three bolts, and then ponder how in the world the next moves could only be 5.11. Unlock that puzzle, and an airy run to bolt five guarantees you will stir yer grits.	5	25	
1527	Believer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1294	Sport	60	5.11b	3.99	This line is the first bolted route encountered after walking through the arch. Look to your left 10 feet after you walk through the arch for a face with a few bolted lines. Climb finger pockets to a sit down rest then take on the overhanging headwall above.	6	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/48334f04ea162
1528	Special Boy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1296	Sport	75	5.11c	4.06	Move right from Believer to the next bolted line. Begin with a thin start which leads to better holds and fun climbing with a nice hueco rest midway. Keep it together for the long run to the anchors.	7	25	
1529	Fallen Angel	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1297	Trad	70	5.11c	3.71	Locate a beautiful crack splitting the face right of the previous lines. Crank through sporty moves to reach an expanding right-facing dihedral near the top which offers a bit of relief.	8	25	
1530	Gluttony	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1298	Sport	75	5.12a	4.23	Step right from Fallen Angel to locate this bolted line. Climb up a slab and crack then move out onto the face at the third bolt. Crank through a tough move to reach a sloping ledge. Continue up the overhanging face on perfect pockets to reach the vertical run to the anchors.	9	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564a7efbd36e1,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4a36f9c26a3e5

Crawl THROUGH the cave on the belay ledge for 30ft. to reach the anchors of Looking Through the Devil's Window on the opposite side of Purgatory and rappel. Bring a #5 camalot for the belay.	10	3	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8cdc86703ed,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f8cdc6bcea7c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399be2c20287
1532	The Proverbial Donkey	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1511	Trad	100	5.11a	0	Start in an alcove 20ft. left of Dracula behind a large, spearhead boulder. Work up the face to gain a fist crack in a roof. A fall before here would be very bad with the spine of the boulder directly below you. Note, the second is also in danger of swinging into the boulder as you cannot protect the low section. Work up the crack system over several ledges until a comfy belay ledge directly under a 15ft. roof. Bail out here for a higher quality climb at 5.10b R or continue out the roof on shakey jams and bad feet to chain anchors just past the lip of the roof. 60m. rope required.	11	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399bbec50fc7
1533	Dracula '04	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1299	Sport	60	5.13b	5	Move right from The Proverbial Donkey to the next bolted line marked by a sharp corner. Power through the initial technical and brutal moves to reach a decent clipping hold. Climb a crack for a few feet then bust left. Hold your breath for the clip then make your way to the next bolt. Recharge for the long run to the anchors. Great climbing. Gets wet near last few moves during heavy rain.	12	38	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5250c95c4d1ab,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5250c91637e37,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/507bf4691eead,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/448d9c6946941
1534	Lucifer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1300	Sport	100	5.14c	5	To the right of Dracula '04. Climb relatively easy moves to the third bolt then bust left through a V7 boulder problem to reach a quick shake at the fourth bolt. Recharge then boulder through a more difficult section to reach a moderate rest at the fifth bolt. From the fifth, endure the redpoint run to the break. At the break, ponder on what a bad ass mofo you are, then finish it up.	13	46	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53553a6b39acf,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4b0ad3ef57e48,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4b0ad3d13d7b4

1536	Paradise Lost	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1302	Sport	65	5.13a	4.88	This line is destined to become a classic. Move right from The Castle Has Fallen to take on the striking overhanging arete. Begin climbing the seam then traverse right past small pockets to gain a large ledge rest. When recovered, launch up the overhanging arete through big moves on small edges to a heart breaker crux just before reaching the final jugs. The route was originally climbed without using the ledge after the initial traverse and given a grade of 5.13b.	15	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5a26040a2949c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/507bf53e223d0,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/507bf50143d31,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/507bf4ab49c5c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4f9eddc3da6b7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/469d21a05e969,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/469d218c35519,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/448d9ae9db0d4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/448d9b10cbeb4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/448d9b2f70826,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/448d9c95bf420,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/449614edd1b7f

1540	Back in the Days of Bold	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1468	Trad	85	5.11c	5	Step right around the corner from The Gimp to locate this broken fingercrack. Work your way up the low fingercrack on the left, boulder up to regain the higher crack. Follow the widening, flaring crack until it ends then friction on an easy, but sparsly protected slab to chain anchors.	19	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399be4b1b467

Protect out of a pocket and follow the line of least resistance up the slab to a tree.	21	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4399be72a66f7
2034	Hatfield	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1953	Sport	80	5.10d	4.05	When you reach the cliff from the approach trail there will be three bolted lines to your left. This is the furthest left line. A long and sustained pumper which doesn't offer as many tasty iron oxide jugs as the line to the right. Your forearms might be screaming as you clip the chains.	1	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4667377b297b5,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/452997d615bfd

Sneak right above good thin pro for the hard boulder problem crux up top. The steep handcrack in the middle suffers from a thorny blackberry bush that seems to regrow every spring and would benefit from some more aggressive gardening by the second ascent party.	7	25

Brief crimpy start leads to easy jug climbing before encountering the first of two shallow arches. Move up right and into the first shallow flake exiting out left on to the face and then straight up with a few well-placed finger pockets and positive iron oxide edges heading to the second shallow arch. Climb up and towards the lower right end of the second arch then out left onto the face on edges before heading straight up on heinous crimps.

Keeping the wall to your right, soon you will reach a left-facing and right-facing pair of closely-spaced dihedrals that merge 35 ft up into an acute dihedral which is capped by a roof and a 15-ft crack. Begin in the left dihedral; at some point in the roof you'll be looking at your feet riding recumbent. Pull over the roof and clip chain anchors on the headwall. Gear: a few 12-in and 24-in slings, double rack 0-#3, #4 and #5 for the roof.	3	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5907b80c5589c

Continue up the orange face to the corner system (#5 or 6 useful but not mandatory) and follow that out to another rightward traverse on good holds, then a hand crack up to a nice ledge system with another bolt. Clip this and keep it together for the crux moves leading to the anchor. If you attempt to lower off from the anchor, a 60m rope may not make it all the way to the ground, although there is a good ledge about 40' up to belay your second from.	20	15	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/514775ed72321

Starts 10 feet left of Alternative Medicines on solid edges past a few bulges and ledges leading to iron imbued pale gray sandstone covered with orange lichen. Climbing steepens slightly near mid-point and the holds change to shallow pocket, crimps and pinches. Work your way up and over a couple more mild bulges using the occasional pockets, sidepulls, jugs and undercling. Follow the path of least resistance traversing to the right at the last bolt around the bulge on good feet then up through killer fin-like runnels to the anchors.	22	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5288f07426fc4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5288f066d1940

2507	Buddhalicious	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2006	Sport	60	5.11b	3.97	20 feet left of ''Golden Road" is this fine climb.

Originally thought to be a trad route, but the gear wasn't good enough to keep it from being R-rated. A reachy start on good jugs takes you to a ledge from which you can step left and cruise the crack above. Technical and enjoyable. First route put up at Coyote Cliff. There is an optional boulder problem direct start.	6	13	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/45676420d0854

Then climb into the hueco and, you guessed it, clip the anchors from a big undercling.	7	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/456762a628a5d,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/45424544c416a

Gently climb past a brief crumbly bulge (crux) to sequential pockets on good rock above. The route ends under a small roof with bolted anchors. There is a good reason why this route has no stars. Climb it at your own risk.	8	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/45676329d43c3

A bouldery start will lead to a small cave (beware of the woodrats). Carefully climb the crack and flake to gain the pocketed face above.

Belay up high on a ledge system that is best accessed from the right. A 2-bolt extension bumps the grade to 12- and is worth climbing if dry.	19	24

Traverse right along the ledge to the high first bolt (that can easily be clipped standing on the ledge) or climb "Revenge of the Sith" as a direct start. Pull the roof and then jug haul up the overhanging arete to a vertical, but slightly more technical finish. The rock quality is much better than it looks. Fun moves.	3	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5294e971dff7f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5294e9385151b

2502	Grey Matter	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1600	Toprope	40	5.10b	2.6	Just right of ''Brain Stem" is a thin slabby arete. The route climbs the face right of the arete. Make a few long reaches and enjoy some technical climbing to gain the juggy slab above.	18	17	
2685	Sierra's Travels	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1136	Mixed	45	5.9-	2.06	Leftmost route to the left of the big cave with a picnic table. Start directly under first bolt. Left hand slopey crimp to a sidepull. Then stand up and follow the obvious line to the anchors.	1	11	
2686	Heard It On NPR	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1137	Sport	100	5.10d	3.82	This adventure climb begins with a high first bolt left of Spider Crux. Climb through 65 feet of 5.9 on sometimes questionable holds to reach a ledge. Continue through the overhanging pocketed face for 35 feet to reach the anchors. This route is kind of like NPR because you have to wait a long time for something good. Use a 60 meter rope	2	19	
2687	Spider Crux	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1138	Mixed	50	5.10b	3.2	Start under a small roof to gain this attractive, right-leaning hand and finger crack. Make a long move then continue up easier ground to a two-bolt anchor on the ledge. Belay, rappel off here, or continue up ''Heard It On NPR".	3	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/Spidercrux.jpg
2688	Cordillera Rojo	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1570	Sport	115	5.11a	1.85	A not so great adventure climb with lots of bad rock on the second pitch.Start immediately right of ''Spider Crux" and left of "Barenjager". Follow 4 bolts to the ledge system, rest as long as your conscience will allow, and launch up the unrelenting and imposing headwall above. A 70 meter rope is not long enough to lower off, so it needs to either be done in 2 pitches (there is an intermediate anchor) or the climber will have to figure out how to set up a rappel.	4	23	
2689	Barenjager	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1139	Sport	40	5.10d	3.42	This route ascends the overhanging face 10-15 ft. right of Spider Crux. Follow a line of 4 bolts up pockets, flakes, and edges to a 2 bolt anchor.	5	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/44c93407c8a86,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/44c933ece59d3,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/Barenjager.jpg

Similar to Barenjager, but slightly harder with bigger, pumpier moves and a sequential crux.	6	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/4cdf7611e42e2
2691	Tradmill	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1141	Trad	40	5.7	3.2	Climb obvious left-leaning ramp. Step around this obstacle then cruise up the left-leaning ramp over a small bulge. Clip the chain anchors on the left or continue into the cave. Build an anchor in the enormous cave and belay or traverse left along the ledge to ''Spider Crux" anchors.	7	6	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/43b9bfec780c7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/Tradmill.jpg
2692	Sticks and Stones	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1142	Mixed	35	5.11+	5	Begin at base of Tradmill. Climb up to roof and hand traverse 10-15 ft. right to gain handcrack. Place some gear, then crank through the thinning and steepening crack to a good horizontal. Clip the bolt and make the move to the jug. Crimp your way to the anchors.	8	27	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/43b9bfaac89d7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/SticksandStones.jpg
2693	Bad Dentures	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1143	Toprope	70	5.9	0	First recorded route done in Muir Valley. Walk 100 ft. right of Sticks and Stones. Follow ledge system up to an arete that is often wet. Climb left side of slabby arete to a large ledge with a tree.	9	12	
2819	Silent Circle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3157	Sport	45	5.12d	3.4	From the power grid walk back down to the road and continue right along the wall looking for a short trail after about 100 feet. This trail leads to a nice overhanging section of cliff which unfortunately is characterized by swampy ground at the base. It's short but promises to pack a punch that hits you square in the eye right at the chains.	1	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450e9d3cce2b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545040d6479e1
2820	Nerves of Steel	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3158	Sport	70	5.11b	2.25	Begin as for Silent Circle but cut right and swing up the wall to a high ledge. Surmount the roof and finish with a couple bolts worth of airy edge climbing.	2	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450e9b9aca8d
2821	Jericho	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3159	Sport	50	5.11c	3	Don't let the appearance of the start keep you away from this one. Climb up to a triangular roof at mid height. Finagle a rest then exit into the wickedly cool crux.	3	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54ed258c730a5,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54ecf8f2f1c23,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450413d5bfca
2822	Black Feather	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3160	Sport	50	5.11d	3	The last route on the right before the arete for this section of the wall. Start with a couple of dirty moves, which quickly merge with power pulls on deep pockets culminating in a potentially desperate toss to a small hueco. As with the other lines on the wall if you can deal with the dirty start you will be rewarded with some great movement.	4	26	
2823	Blake's arête	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3161	Toprope	25	Unknown	5	A short toprope problem on the arete right of Black Feather. Equipped by Blake Bowling.	5	9999	
2824	Matrix (Open Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3162	Sport	45	5.14	0	Right of the previous group of lines, the wall takes on a striking angular nature. This open project awaits the no-holds body English masters. Equipped by Kipp Trummel in 2014.	6	43	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511c39ec8ab,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450417eab830
2825	Nightmare in the Beauty	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3163	Sport	70	5.12c	4.33	Just around the corner from Matrix is what may be one of the nicest looking walls in the area. The climbing on this wall holds up to its beauty. However this line could be a nightmare for the less creative climber in us. Begin with high tips in a crack and toss up to a horn. The rest is up to your imagination. Enjoy.	7	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450eafe2e42d,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545041932201f
2826	Cursing Kirk	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3164	Sport	70	5.11c	3.5	It's a reachy one! Lobster claw pinching buys you a sit down rest on the ledge. The sequel requires some endurance and enough juice to make a couple of difficult long pulls. Go big or go small at the upper crux.	8	25	
2827	Birdman	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3165	Sport	70	5.11c	3.67	Sequential underclinging and sidepulling gets you to the sit-down ledge. Mostly decent holds minus an obvious teeny tiny crimpy cruxy up high.	9	25	
2828	Creepy Karpis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3166	Sport	70	5.11c	1.67	This line was already in place long before the land purchase and lacked a few bolts critical for keeping the climber off the ground and the ledge. It's safer now but still wanders a bit. Regardless it's another good line if you can pull the initial reachy moves.	10	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5759cc01be804
2829	Dope on a Rope	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3167	Sport	70	5.11b	3.7	The juggier and steeper of the lines on this wall. Reach high for a deep horizontal to pull over a small roof and into a quick pockety section. After that, enjoy the fun flow of good old fashioned Red River steep jug hauling complete with a no-hands double knee bar rest. Remember though, another trait of those old fashioned jug hauls is to spit in your face right at the chains.	11	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450e74c89bf3,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545041ef44790
2830	Traumatized Turtle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3168	Sport	55	5.9+	2.25	Continue right along the cliffline for about 150 feet to meet up with a trio of routes on a geometric face. This is the first on the left and follows large ledges up the low angled face.	12	13	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5640f072ae116
2831	Regulation Number Five	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3169	Sport	55	5.12c	3	Begin as for Traumatized Turtle but exit right near the first bolt. Mantel up to a distinct crux toss to a decent edge using the best foot smear you can find. 5.9 moves lead to a perplexing thin tips crack finish.	13	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450421a3a4bc
2832	Scruff Puppy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3170	Sport	60	5.12a	4	A sequential and difficult face climb leads to a right angling mega steep pump delivering arete. Pull up into a pod making use of sketchy looking but solid orange blobby rock. The line was originally going to end at the second set of chains but deemed too difficult for old guys.	14	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511dac08ce1,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511ca9ae714
2833	Square Bob Sponge Pants	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3171	Sport	80	5.11a	2.75	Continuing along the trail takes you to a pair of long lines just right of a crack and before the trail heads downhill to a flat spot. This begins either in the crack or on the face beneath the bolt. Cruxy movement leads through enough rests to keep the grade moderate. An excellent roof pull guards the chains.	15	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54504265b22c4
2834	Slingo	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3172	Sport	80	5.11b	3.57	Just right of Square Bob is another long journey through off-balance twisted movement up a striking arete with some extra spice thrown in. Think Prime Directive.	16	24	
2835	Reign of Terror (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3173	Sport	85	Unknown	0	Head down from the previous lines to another pair of lines clocking in somewhat harder. This is the left line. Equipped by Kipp Trummel, 2014.	17	9999	
2836	Fatal Vision	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3174	Sport	85	5.11c	4.78	Begin in a thin flake system and climb the long face and arete using every trick in the book. Sneak around to the right if you are feeling perplexed. One of the better lines on this section of cliff.	18	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450429bbb2a5
2837	The Motherland	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3175	Sport	70	5.12d	0	This odd route begins on the arete right of Fatal Vision but actually climbs to a ledge about 30 feet up where it's possible to walk back down to where you started so you can pull your rope and not do the rest of the route.	19	33	
2838	Poking a Dead Frog	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3176	Sport	60	5.11c	3	Just around the corner from Fatal Vision and right of a gorgeous corridor is a tall wall with several lines. This is the first on the left and begins on a boulder. A sequential array of slopers eases up long enough to prepare you for the vicious crimps at top. Glue ins.	20	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545042ba1fc6f
2839	Red Fern	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3177	Sport	70	5.11c	3.17	This quality line begins on the same boulder as Dead Frog. Reach for a sloping ledge at the start and pop up into a small hueco for some great technical yet pumpy climbing.	21	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe06c846f5,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe035899ca,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545042e0f1acb
2840	Man with a Wooden Leg	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3178	Sport	70	5.10c	2.81	There are two lines exiting the large orange hueco roof blob. This is the left one. Traverse a dirty shelf to reach the roof and pull on precarious jugs to get onto the face where the fun begins. A variety of underclings, crimps, and high steps make this route fairly technical but it still overhangs enough to deliver a nice pump. Glue ins.	22	18	
2841	Sweet Petunia	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3179	Sport	70	5.10d	2.27	Traverses the same dirty shelf to start but begins a bit further right. A bit more sustained than Wooden Leg with a much harder crux exiting the hueco up high.	23	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe0e4b345f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fe0bd3c365
2842	Flight Risk	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3180	Sport	95	5.12a	3	Walk down from the previous group of lines and through a marshy alcove to reach this line. Tough moves with decent rests make up the first half while a more sustained section takes you to the chains. Be sure to use a full 60m rope.	24	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/562eb398417e4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5450faf254ffa
3105	Huge Tracts of Sand	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3663	Trad	45	5.8	0	This is the first corner at end of approach trail. Do not climb. No anchors, rap from tree on left side of finish ledge. What's wrong with her? She's beautiful, she's rich, she's got huge... tracts of... sand! This rock is pure choss and too soft for anchors.	1	9	
3106	Brave Sir Robin	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3664	Sport	45	5.10c	2.5	Start on the flake/slab.

No really, it starts here. The scary looking jugs in the roof are actually pretty solid.

The rest of the route lacks a bit in the rock quality department but makes up for it with its height, steepness, and the occasional sprinkling of a tough move or two when you are feeling a little cocky.	8	30	
2813	Crazy Train	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3270	Sport	85	5.11d	4	Begin atop a boulder on cheater stones and reach for a pair of good holds. Once established launch into a killer sequence of moves which quickly end with a tricky mantel onto a sloping ledge. If you've somehow ended up horizontal, getting stood back up may be the crux. Some of the biggest holds on the wall lead up the remainder of the route.	9	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554abb79ed0da
2814	Nightmare on Hell Creek	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3534	Trad	50	5.9+	3	Walk right from Crazy Train 200 feet until you find this left angling obtuse dihedral. Good crack technique needed at top where small face holds get smaller. Use the anchors on the left that are part of an unfinished sport route.	9	13	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5a2d8cc573341
2815	Due in Time	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3535	Trad	50	5.7	3	A few feet left of Countdown is another left angling dihedral that starts up a slab to a ledge, and then follows the crack to anchors.	9	6	
2816	Countdown	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3271	Sport	65	5.12c	3.75	This line can be found on the far right side of Cloud 9, not far from Infirmary. Less than vertical climbing steepens to vertical where the moves get tough.	10	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554aba6fef7aa
2817	Nimbus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3536	Sport	45	5.12a	0	Shorter and a bit easier than Countdown with a great boulder problem down low. Keep breathing because the hard vertical climbing continues.	11	30	
3308	The Unmentionable	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3346	Trad	35	5.8+	2.83	Clean left-facing dihedral starting 12' right of Nystagmus. Traverse left at the top to a shared bolt anchor.	0	10	
3309	Nystagmus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3325	Sport	30	5.8	2.43	Short face with a roof start 12' left of a left-facing dihedral. Balancey face crux up top.	0	9	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5549668297989
3310	La NAMBLA	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3374	Sport	50	5.9	2.82	25 feet right of Grain of Salt is this funky, featured, slightly creepy orange face.	0	12	
3311	Grain of Salt	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2677	Sport	50	5.10c	2.38	When approaching Cooper's Cove from the right (Serenity Point) this bolted line is about 100 feet before the main overhanging wall. Begin with a big move to reach slightly overhanging but short lived climbing.	1	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/522c6586c824b
3312	Sending in the Rain	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3553	Sport	60	5.8	2.25	Start at the top of the hill around the corner from Gas Huffer on the right of the two face climbs. A short blank section down low requires a bit of lock off and reach. Then enjoy relaxed and casual climbing above with plenty of good holds and rests to choose from.	1	9	
3313	All Washed Up	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3542	Sport	60	5.10d	3	Start on the top of the hill just around the corner from Gas Huffer and traverse quickly to the left to the first bolt. Take a quick shake at the jugs and figure out the low crux which guards enjoyable more moderate face climbing above	1	19	
3314	Gas Huffer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2676	Sport	60	5.11c	3.33	Begin left of the arete on the right side of the main overhanging wall and just right of a short ramp. A couple of steep pulls gets you into thin climbing which can deliver a wicked pump despite the angle of the rock.	2	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54e20fdfc5636,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b43d5ac63,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b28665c46
3315	Shake Down	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2675	Sport	60	5.11a	3.45	Second bolted line from the right on the main steep wall. Begin by climbing fragile but large holds on a less than vertical orange face left of a mini dihedral. Reach steeper rock above where some challenging crimps and some of the best moves on the wall.	3	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a24696af8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a1ffe3ac8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b47a4d59b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b2fcaccf8
3316	Where the Sidewalk Ends	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2674	Sport	60	5.10d	3.15	Nice flowing moves with a roof crux near the top. May feel a bit spicy for some but hang in there, the holds are big. After the roof trend left because there's some perma-dirt and possibly damp rock up there.	4	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b6a203c8f
3317	Diesel Therapy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2673	Sport	60	5.11a	3.24	An excellent line which begins with jugs in a dihedral of sorts. A great warm-up for the wall. Enough rests to keep the pump from destroying you for the day.	5	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235af90bc7c3
3318	Road Kill	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2672	Sport	60	5.10c	3.59	A stellar but tough line for the grade. If you can get to the hueco down low you've got this one in the bag as long as you pace yourself.	6	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b00e63903
3319	Pure Pleasure	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2671	Sport	60	5.11b	3.57	The name says it all. Begin with a few bolts of bouldery moves on decent pockets to reach a great straddle rest, which could possibly be pleasureful, if you're inclined. Continue on through great movement to reach a thin tricky move with a few different options just before the chains.	7	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a1ab643e7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a19107557,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a18042ca4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b0656e8ac
3320	Addiction	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2670	Sport	60	5.11c	3.46	Just left of Pure Pleasure is what may be the best line on the wall. Bust through a low sidepull crux to gain enjoyable moves on big holds. Difficult height dependent moves on angled small crimps guard the last couple of bolts before the chains. If you're out left staring up and over at the chains about to say take just go big! Stick clipping the second bolt may prevent unnecessary wandering.	8	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b2095a8ad,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b0e99af94
3321	Grab n' Go	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2669	Sport	60	5.10d	3.36	A typical RRG steep jug haul. Pick a hold and aim for the big tongue. The rock quality improves at bolt 3.	9	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b19655e1e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235a3bad0cd0,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235a0d95cb9e
3322	Grundle Bundle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3304	Sport	60	5.11a	3.6	Begin on a flat boulder and just left of Grab n' Go. An easy approach to a low pocket crux opens up to gigantic, solid jugs to reach a nearly no-hands rest mid-height. More jugs entice you into a final sequence of tough pulling to reach the chains. Equipped with glue-in bolts.	10	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54e2172b3f9c7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54e216124b550
3323	Poop Dolla!!	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2668	Sport	55	5.11b	3	Opposite the joke this is more like shit on top of the dollar. What appears as a pile actually climbs quite nicely. The line goes straight up from the last bolt so if it's wet to the left at top it is probably still okay to climb.	11	24	
3324	The Devil in the White City	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2780	Sport	60	5.12a	2.5	Start from cheater stones right of a large tree. Often appears to be covered in grime which is more than likely the case. If you've done the rest of the wall then it's worth getting on.	12	30	
3325	Bay Harbor Butcher	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2736	Sport	65	5.11b	3.12	Begin left of the large tree with high holds and no feet on some cheater stones. Climb through nice pockets and edges on steep rock. Like the series, the finale of this one isn't so great either. Maybe it still has a chance with a bit of cleanup?	13	24	
3326	The Hustle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2667	Sport	60	5.11b	3.91	A close contender with Addiction for the best route on the wall. Begin left of the 6 foot high roof with a blocky right hand and reach high for a left crimp to get started. Solid holds with a couple of solid cruxes deliver a solid pump.	14	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b57ab30a6,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/522c8ae2cb28c
3327	Russian Body Thief	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2666	Sport	60	5.11b	3	Currently the leftmost line on the wall. Begins with large holds which quickly diminish into thin and somewhat technical climbing with the occasional pocket where you need it.	15	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b5b3830c3
3328	For Goodness Blake	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3061	Trad	30	5.5	2	From the main Cooper's Cove wall walk left and around the corner to locate another cluster of bolted lines. This is a short but fun flake before the first bolted line.	16	4	
3329	Work Therapy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3060	Sport	60	5.11c	3.53	This line has a tufa-like feature which just begs to be climbed. A short approach gets you to the tufa where proper execution of moves will prevent the ol' barndoor from swinging open. Big moves between big holds on steepening rock make up the second half of the line.	17	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/551ec98d6fb8b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508cae5e320b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544993cfc07c1
3330	Unstable Behavior	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3059	Sport	70	5.12a	2.63	Stick clip the high first bolt to start. Hand traverse a ledge then move quickly past blobby, fragile feeling jugs for a hands free ledge. More easy stop and go ledge and slot climbing leads to one difficult move after which the jugs begin again. This may be the best definition of a one-move wonder.	18	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508c96c66d43
3331	Head Case	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3058	Trad	40	5.9	4	This traditionally protected line shares anchors with Self Medication. Gear placements can be a bit advanced so be sure to bring your A game. Or just reach around the corner and clip the bolts.	19	12	
3332	Self Medication	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3057	Sport	40	5.11c	3.61	Don't walk past this just because it's short. Just left of an overhanging arete is a short line of bolts. A long move leads into a quick but fun run on crimps. Climb slow and think about football to make it last longer.	20	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/551ec9ef1b408,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5449928bf0ed8
2779	Pedophile with Cancer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2934	Trad	40	5.8	2.17	As you reach the buttress at the top of the trail this short, wide crack is immediately visible. Great for those with large fists or a propensity for self torture (aka offwidth climbers).	1	9	
2780	Podular	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2956	Trad	80	5.9	3	Walk right from where the trail meets the wall to locate this right-facing corner with a low roof. Good hand jams and face holds get you over the roof where a long, mellow journey through ledges and jugs awaits. Bring a #4 Camalot for the squeeze chimney at the top. Shares anchors with Elevator Pitch.	2	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254b7b80ee9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254b34cec62,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254b1d8ef5d,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5314d063e5526
2781	Elevator Pitch	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2957	Sport	80	5.10a	3.74	The first bolted line encountered, just right of a crack, as the trail meets the wall. A challenging intro move buys you a ticket on this fun ride. Super solid rock, well bolted, long, and pumpy make this one of the better lines for the grade.	3	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254afccc135,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508ac0abbe38,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5314c5745b137
2782	Bookworm	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2958	Mixed	100	5.11b	3	Pitch 1 (5.8) - An acute dihedral around the corner from a Elevator Pitch. Better than it looks, despite a little mud. FA Dustin Stephens, Andrew Gearing, 2014.Pitch 2 (5.11b) - tackle the low roof to gain easy crack climbing and balancy face climbing protected by a couple of bolts. FA Symon Ardila, Dustin Stephens, 2014.	4	24	
2783	Blockbuster	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2960	Trad	45	5.9	2.13	Discontinuous crack system 25 right of Bookworm, before the big tree. At the top, move slightly left for medium-large cam placements in horizontals.	5	12	
2784	Old Growth	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2961	Sport	105	5.12b	3.38	Pitch 1 (5.11b) - Immediately right of a large tree is a shallow dihedral where this route begins. Use the tree, or don't, to reach decent slots and edges which become large finger ledges near the top. This line serves as a good way to reach the ledge routes if you don't want to scramble up the muddy gully further right.Pitch 2 (5.12b)- continues over the roof from the ledge and adds an extra 60 feet with 7 bolts.	6	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55078994b1b8a
2785	Understory	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2963	Sport	45	5.12b	3.67	This short but tough face climb is marked by a pair of enticing iron oxide jugs about twelve feet up.	7	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508aad112893
2786	Chimney Sweep	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2965	Trad	45	5.7	2	Walk back into the narrowing corridor around the corner from Understory and choose your width. Shuffle and scoot up to a ledge then move up through a slot to reach a large ledge.	8	6	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53161d404e57b
2787	Hot Mess	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3006	Sport	65	5.11a	3.25	LEDGE ROUTE: The sport route just left of the Awkward Threesome crack. Begin on a large pile of cheater stones and jump for a jug in the roof. Good holds over the lip lead to a nice, mellow ride on orange and black jugs. A potentially dangerous runout from the last bolt to the chains may be eliminated with the addition of a bolt eventually. If you see eight bolts then you are good. If you see seven, be careful.	9	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508aa0ac12ec
2788	Awkward Threesome	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2966	Trad	70	5.11a	3.67	LEDGE ROUTE: This wandering, naturally protected face climbing is located on a ledge above and right of Chimney Sweep. The ledge can be reached by scrambling up a gully 50 feet right of Chimney Sweep or by climbing the first pitch of Old Growth or the surrounding lines.	10	23	
2789	Compulsion	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2967	Sport	65	5.11b	4	LEDGE ROUTE: Just right of Awkward Threesome is another fair line which also begins with a low roof. This one has a bit of slab in it. It's a great line but often wet when the two lines left of it aren't.	11	24	
2790	Nobody Cares	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3559	Sport	90	5.9	0	A long heavily featured slab that begins 25 feet left of Geller's Spoon. The base is mostly blank so start uphill and leftof the first bolt on jugs and gain instant exposure going to the high first bolt.	11	12	
2791	Geller's Spoon	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2968	Sport	100	5.11a	3.5	Walk right from the previous group of ground level lines to reach this bolted line, which marks the beginning of the serene, pine laden section of the cliff. Start in left-facing scoop marked by black bolt hangers. A low crux leads to slabby and sometimes furry climbing which steepens near the top.	12	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508b287509df,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5359dc1cf1d37
2792	Capsaicin Sea	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2969	Sport	105	5.11b	3.88	A thin crack beginning gets you into a muddy fat flake with a tree growing from it, making for several good root jugs. Ladder up on large iron oxide ledges and a couple of long moves to finish in a challenging groove. Currently there is good potential for a ledge fall between bolts 6 and 7 and possibly 7 and 8 so don't fall or don't climb it.	13	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/538951b4c6daa,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5359e126236cf
2793	Symbiosis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2970	Mixed	90	5.11b	4.06	Either climb the crack far left of the first bolt (which is also the first pitch of Histoplasmosis) or the mossy face beneath it to start this unbelievably good face climb. A roof pull at the fifth bolt is the gateway to exposed and wild ride that is well worth the entry fee. If you bypass the crack, be careful clipping the second bolt and take a #3 Camalot to protect the run to the third. The remainder is well bolted. Note that the two glue-in bolts making up the alternate start of this line may be pulled by the FA at some point.	14	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254be682243,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254bc766dbd,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53139fcf7977f
2794	Histoplasmosis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2972	Trad	80	5.10c	4.2	This 2 pitch line begins by climbing the flake that also makes up the first pitch of Symbiosis. Where Symbiosis cuts left out of the flake and onto the bolted face, this line is accessed by continuing up the crack and into the cave instead of cutting left. A wide roof crack offers plenty of jugs hidden within.	15	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/531ba0a533f61
2795	Monolith	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2973	Sport	50	5.12c	4	The right angling line of glue in bolts on the blank face left of an ar�te. Good shoes and good temps recommended.	16	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5362f6b841801
2796	Cornerstone	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2975	Sport	95	5.13d	5	Walk right, passing a greenish dihedral with a very thin crack (unclimbed). A striking bolted, perfectly square and shallow dihedral leads to enjoyable, overhanging climbing above. Can you pinch the corner of a building and get off the ground? If so, you may stand a chance.	17	40	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508bd81021cb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508ad5507b54,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53139f9ba9185
2797	Dayglo-a-Go-Go	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2976	Mixed	80	5.10d	4	A thin, picturesque dihedral leads to juggy, bolted face climbing. Begin on a diseased looking ledge with a glue-in bolt as the first piece.

2798	Totoro	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2977	Sport	80	5.12b	4.2	Just left of a tree is this stellar face climb which begins with gravely holds but quickly switches to deep iron oxide pockets and a smack down at bolt three. The second half is a mega-fun 11a pump fest.	19	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254c8d4b7aa,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55254c7499918,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53139f5b8431b

3217	Tsunami	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3399	Sport	50	5.13a	5	Walk left of the ledge routes about 100 feet until you reach a small amphitheater hosting several sport routes. This is the line of glue-ins just left of the obvious arete on the right side of the wall. A jump start to three bolts of 5.10 jugs leads to several hard boulder problems with a good rest between. A slam dunk dyno to a mailbox slot tops off this bouldery line.	1	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59e6bf06917f2,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5653474acdd3f

3225	The Guillotine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2809	Sport	75	5.13b	3	On the opposing wall left of The Abyss is a pair of lines on the vertical to overhanging wall. Precarious movement leads to a roof where creative footwork is crucial to holding the swing while slapping for the good hold. Equipped by John Flunker in 2013. Anchors have chains and Q-links to lower/rap from, and 2 permadraws now exist in the roof section.	7	38	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54511ec95e7f3

Unclipping the fifth and skipping the second fixed chain will reduce the rope drag. Perma-draw equipped.	8	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d69ad56a2e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d69960fb5f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d696152597,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534c80424227f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a0ed6929b5e
3227	Adult Swim	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2811	Sport	90	5.13a	4.36	This is the middle steep line on the main wall. Begin with high iron oxide edges then pull up into a nose-feature where the difficult climbing begins. Crank through a few bolts worth of pocket tweaking to reach a well needed rest before the steep headwall. An onsite killer awaits before the last bolt.	9	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53b8149db6cbc,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a215dc68efc,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a132303ff63

3230	Half Mast	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2814	Sport	55	5.11b	3.61	The obvious fin arete. Negotiate a low bulge with awkward moves at the first bolt to make a somewhat sketchy second clip. Take on the face making use of the rounded arete when possible. The longer your reach the less chance of needing to leave the comfort of the arete for more difficult crimping on the face.	12	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5525f0a9ce195,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a216130a1b6
3231	Peeping Tom	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3312	Trad	65	5.8	1.75	This is the juggy dihedral which leads to an open offwidth near the top. Begins just right of Half Mast.	13	9	
3232	Pool Boy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2815	Sport	75	5.10b	3.53	This line starts the same as the line to the right but heads straight up past a low two-finger pocket crux. Near the middle pass a tempting ledge to the left and run it out on big holds to the next bolt where the moves get even bigger.	14	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/571f68f0c7c46,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/565be9bc3fbc9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a216279ba5d
3233	Fluffer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2816	Sport	70	5.10a	3.49	When the approach trail meets the cliff walk right and around the corner from the main wall to locate a pair of lines right of a sharp arete. This is the rightmost line. Negotiate a slightly dirty start to gain the face which begins with technical thin climbing and leads to larger holds on steeper terrain.	15	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a216369e131
3235	Fruitcake	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3094	Trad	60	5.10a	3	About thirty feet right of the main wall is this crack climb which begins on a ledge. Begin with steep stemming which you wish could go on but instead meets up with an offwidth and not so solid flake. Take some larger gear for the offwidth.	1	16	
3236	Pineapple Express	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3112	Sport	50	5.12a	3.97	On the right side of the main wall is a shorter section with a ledge where this and the next few routes begin from. Reach over the initial roof for a jug then launch into big reaches and mostly moderate climbing with a brief boulder problem mid-route.	2	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54079ee530d98,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54078044c6c27
3237	Breakfast at Koops	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3018	Sport	60	5.11d	4.56	Pumpy and excellent! Begin as for Pineapple Express but trend left after the first bolt. Race up through a sustained series of angular holds which become pockets and sloping pinches as the angle steepens.	3	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564a7ec3cbf39,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544afd822267f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5405344107160,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5405337b6edb2,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f1b374f570
3238	J's on my Feet	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3017	Sport	70	5.12c	3	This line also begins on the ledge on the right side of the main wall. It shares the first four bolts with another line so don't let that confuse you if you're counting routes. Climb straight up without bailing left at the fourth. Originally the line was bolted to meet up with a wicked, razorcrimp crux but new bolts were added to avoid it. It's now a more doable, killer line that won't split your tips!	4	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564d5684007b8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/547e8f26bafaa,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5359b6727ad4a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f1af426538
3239	Mojo Bro Tank Bar Crawl	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3098	Sport	70	5.12a	3	Climb the first 4 bolts of J's on My Feet then head left through small edges to reach a roof for decent steep climbing on a variety of features.	5	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5511e0ce6e482,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f2af59be1ac,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f2af3ebf73c
3240	Fruit by the Foot	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3317	Sport	80	5.12b	3.83	The last line on the right side of the main wall that begins atop a boulder. Stacked sections of tough moves interspersed with engaging face climbing switches to steep pockets near the top.	6	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564d56bca480d,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5511e2777ee7b
3241	Flaccid Fruit	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3003	Sport	90	5.12b	3.43	This one-move wonder for the one pump chumps begins left of the ledge from which the previous routes began. Thick skin and the desire to send is required due to the small, sharp split-maker crimps.	7	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544aff836bf12
3242	Fruits of my Loins	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3002	Sport	95	5.12d	4	The first bolted line right of the crack splitting the middle of the wall. Begin with some difficult bouldering then launch into a long journey of pumpy climbing with an exciting run or two. Stick clip the third bolt if it hasn't been moved. You'll know if it's directly above the second bolt and tough to clip from the obvious holds on the right.	8	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5739ebf204532,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdba7198e6,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdb5c3bb14
3243	Hourglass Crack	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3016	Trad	100	5.10d	4.6	The obvious overhanging crack splitting the main wall at its highest point. You will actually feel pretty cool on this because you are guaranteed to climb higher than whoever is left and right of you. Jingle those cams and grunt really loudly while talking about how lame sport climbing is. Then pull your stuff up, yell down ''zero bolts bitches!", and rappel down from a tree far away from the climbers you just pissed off. Or lower from the chains and run.	9	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5563c6e668b9e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5546b67227518,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553ed1563d9d7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54a7235581371,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54a72344dc0b6,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/540686362ed66,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f1c99c1959
3244	Banana Hammock	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3000	Sport	95	5.12a	4.09	Just left of the crack splitting the main wall is this line marked by an obvious protrusion near the third bolt. A sequence of challenging sidepull moves leads to the mandatory nut rest on the protrusion. Progress through immensely pumpy edges and hidden pockets separated by decent rests.	10	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/58fd97fc23ac8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/56fb46977fc67,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55c9588d5c404,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/555966f3c44fb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5556d5bb0c14c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdb060fbff,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fdad35523f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fda74d961c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d993d66b09
3245	Witness the Citrus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3001	Sport	95	5.11c	4.61	This is the line climbers come to Fruit Wall for. Two left of Hourglass Crack. A low roof serves as the entry gate to a long run on gigantic jugs. Nothing but fun.	11	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/58992716a5d19,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5556d532cebea,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fd8f734ddb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544af853954e7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53dc59679bdd0,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d9925ede6a
3246	Cannibal Queen	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3015	Sport	80	5.12c	3.5	A line of shallow pockets leads to a roof crux. Sustained climbing around a discontinuous crack system on the slightly overhanging face ends with a wise anchor placement in a roof just before an often wet brown streak.Bad pockets to low roof crux to killer slightly overhanging finish section.	12	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534f19b3e5563
3247	Grapes of Wrath (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3101	Sport	80	5.13+	4	Ends at anchors right of the large notch at the top of the wall. A stopper boulder problem prevents this from being the jug haul you think it would be. Equipped by Shadow Ayala.	13	41	
3248	Watermelon Crawl	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3464	Sport	95	5.12c	4	Start in the dihedral left of Grapes of Wrath. Several hard boulder problems and long sections of large jugs give way to a heart breaker last move.	13	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5776e8169f0c1,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/57769e2678bd5
3249	Conkle Donkle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3013	Sport	90	5.12c	3	What rhymes with Conkle? At the top of the cliff is a large notch extending nearly halfway down the wall. This is the first line left of the notch. Climb up through a roof left of a black and tan crack. Stick with it for the second half where the movement and rock quality greatly improve.	14	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544afa8a0ec34,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d981a019d8
3250	Bumpers & Bogs	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3012	Sport	95	5.12c	2.67	As with Conkle Donkle, put your time in at the bottom for the reward of steeper climbing and better rock quality up higher. A nice rest preps you for the final kickback of the wall where the moves require some serious try-hard.Progressively harder moves lead to a big rest before the wall kicks back and changes to bullet hard rock for the last two or three bolts and the business up top. Heart breaker style, last 3 or 4 moves are the hardest. Tie a knot in the end of your rope!	15	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/534d988282730
3251	Artifact	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3116	Sport	95	5.12b	3	Begin on Bumpers and Bogs but trend left and up the mini dihedral after the first bolt. Large holds and plenty of resting points prime you for the final run on steeper rock with a few tough pinch moves.	16	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d5810c2d88f
3252	Satin Bananas	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3483	Trad	55	5.8	3	Begins at the mouth of the cave right of Melon Baller. Lower from two stoppers.	16	9	
3253	Melon Baller	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3316	Sport	65	5.10d	3.52	This decent warm-up begins from the ledge left of the main steep wall which is accessible via a walk up. It is not necessary to climb the first bolt of Jew Jew Fruit to reach the ledge.	17	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564d569a24ee7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5533bb4640804

Steeper and more ape-like climbing ends with a crowd pleasing anchor clip.	18	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d57bed8f6ce
3255	JewJew Fruit	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2999	Sport	75	5.10c	4.42	The furthest left line accessible from the ledge. The original line begins from the ground by climbing a short crack. Perfect pockets lead off the ledge into slightly overhanging edges and underclings with minimal feet.	19	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5556d48108f99,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5556d4b4bc2da,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/544b01a7a2bcc,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/540275c02ad89
3256	Drosophila	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3011	Sport	80	5.12a	3.65	Just left of Jew Jew Fruit. Pop up onto the initial slab while gunning for a hand ledge to start. A low roof makes way for long moves between slots and a welcome traverse right to dodge the impossible. Keep your short girlfriend off of this one if you want some nookie.	20	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d57d214ce33
3257	Banana Split	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3023	Sport	35	5.8	2.47	Continue left from Jew Jew Fruit to a pair of short lines. This is the better of the two. Scamper up on nice blocky holds and brush the dirt off them for your partner on the way down.	21	9	
3258	Poppin Cherries	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3214	Sport	40	5.8	2.03	The left of the two short 5.8 lines. The name is the best thing about this one. A bit reachier and a bit less fun than the other one.	22	9	
3259	Peach Fuzz	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3213	Sport	50	5.11b	3.82	Continue left and downhill from the pair of short, easy lines. Turn a corner to meet up with a pair of lines on a bright orange section of wall. This is the right line of the two and follows a blunt arete and tufa-like feature. Don't walk past this line thinking it may not be worth the time. The movement is superb and the stone is bullet hard.	23	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d5807f27bf6
3260	Mango Love	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3305	Sport	50	5.12b	3	The line of pockets on bullet hard stone just left of Peach Fuzz.	24	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553ada15153a0
3261	Heath Ledger	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3212	Sport	80	5.10c	2.4	This interesting adventure line begins up in the corner left of Mango Love. If you can make it to the slab up top without breaking an ankle due to potential ledge falls you get a short run of nice slab climbing.	25	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d56df6ca49f
3262	Drag City	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3102	Trad	100	5.10c	3	Suffer through a dirty but easy offwidth just left of the bolted line, Heath Ledger, to reach a belay ledge where an enjoyable, right-facing corner can be accessed. Geat of all sizes but mostly fingers in the crux section.	26	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f7c4a72ca94
3263	First Date	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3539	Sport	50	5.9	3	Bouldery opening move leads to jugs to the top.	26	12	
3264	Lucy in the Sky	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3014	Sport	100	5.11b	3.55	This bolted line with anchors midway up the wall is just right of an arete.About 5.10b to the first anchors at 50 feet.Name: Strawberry Fields, 6 bolts.Description for first pitch: Interesting moves on tufa like features.	27	24	
3265	Orchard Pests	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3211	Trad	60	5.10a	3.1	The low-angle to vertical dihedral capped by a roof. Be careful grappling the block before the roof. There are anchors on the ledge in the middle of the wall.	28	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/588280783b292
3266	Slice of Spice	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2998	Trad	50	5.10a	3.73	This is the obvious, overhanging splitter hand crack just left of Fruit of the Loin. Eats cams and jams. It is guaranteed that you will get to the end and wish it kept going.	29	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/59c2e11fefe74,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d67b81fac7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6791d29cc,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552b0ba57c9fb,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f0263dcd967
3267	Disco Strangler	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3008	Trad	55	5.8+	3.31	Around the corner and left of Slice of Spice is a chimney to splitter fist crack with a large chockstone stuck in the middle. Chimney up to and negotiate this puzzle piece for some great fist jamming.	30	10	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5a1b079ba72da,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5671882ab9a97,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f0265d0a9cb
3268	The Ballad of Paul Shin	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3009	Trad	65	5.9+	2.75	Unfortunately this hand and finger crack is plagued with a section of poor rock in the middle which makes you forget about the enjoyable finger crack in the beginning dihedral.	31	13	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/56568422f0a35,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54b473dac9acd
3269	Lichen Lessons	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3099	Sport	60	5.10c	2.64	This bolted line lies just left of The Ballad of Paul Shin. Climb through features to reach a small roof after which a pocket crux awaits.	32	18	
3270	Tennis Elbow	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3100	Trad	50	5.7	3.25	This handcrack can be found by walking 25 feet left of Disco Strangler. Large gear recommended for the jug-loaded offwidth up top.	33	6

3272	Pickle Head	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3010	Trad	65	5.8+	2.25	If for some reason you are into mud filled cracks then this is your lucky day! Step right up and start digging through the wide, left facing corner to reach anchors on the ledge.	34	10	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54b4751aed68e
3274	A Murder of Crows (Closed Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3381	Sport	85	5.13c	0	The first bolted line at Graveyard on the massive white wall. Starts out easy but the sense on impending doom is omnipresent. Equipped by Shadow Ayala in 2015.	0	39	
3275	Grim Reaper	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2689	Sport	100	5.12a	4.58	Located on the intimidating steep grey wall this line is one of the best of the grade. You will rarely find a route this long and this steep with holds so big your fingers disappear when you grab them. The fun comes with an entry fee though consisting of a tough boulder problem followed by a slightly technical face climb. If you make it past that channel your inner Tarzan and let the swinging begin.	1	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564bf25523e36,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235af4453b52
3276	Electric Funeral	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2690	Sport	100	5.13a	4.5	If Grim Reaper was your kind of line then here's a tougher version for ya. The crux in the middle is technical and height dependent. Don't expect a gimme though even if you have the reach because the pump will still be there.	2	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554f81ea18737,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525e98f6323cf
3277	Gallows March	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2691	Sport	60	5.12b	4.67	This one will put your ape index to the test! A long and tensiony move gets you onto the steep arete loaded with sinker pockets and wrapper jugs. Exit the arete into dynamic moves spanning the extent of the average climber's reach. When in doubt just launch and know it will be good.	3	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545ffb602bedd,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545ff8a673ca1,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b30a9f22c
3278	Grave Digger	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2692	Mixed	70	5.11a	4	Just before a gully in the trail is this pocketed dihedral plagued with a chossy start. If you can stomach the beginning the corner will make you forget about it. A bolted vertical face takes this one beyond the crack. Bring small gear for the corner and a big cam for the chossy start.	4	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b4c02b568
3279	Tombstone	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2693	Mixed	70	5.11b	3	Scramble up to a high, roomy ledge to gain the crack and the first couple pieces of pro. Climb a hollowish, but easy, flake to gain the relief of a delicate and technical bolted face.	5	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b2990938d
3280	Pall Bearer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2694	Trad	60	5.9	4.1	This striking, left arching hand crack is guaranteed to have you pulling the cams out of the closet. A tricky corner switch guards the chains.	6	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5235b2c5b55ee
3281	Dead Baby	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3338	Trad	30	5.8	0	The short corner right of Cousin of Death. Gear to 3''.	7	9	
3282	The Cousin of Death	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2769	Sport	60	5.11d	3.5	This line takes on the stunning rounded arete around the corner from Pall Bearer crack. A shin buster start leads to the arete which requires creative hand shuffling and on-the-go foothold ticking. This one is far from straightforward.	8	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5304c48d6e275
3283	Evil Dead	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2770	Sport	60	5.12a	3	Around the corner from Cousin of Death is a clean, easy looking slab loaded with bolts. This is the first on the right and requires seasons in Tuolumne or some sort of wizardry to ascend. 4 stars if you like slab, -5 stars if you don't.	9	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/526fbc5b307f1
3284	Smoking the Dark Crystal	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2771	Sport	60	5.12a	4	Another wickedly difficult slab climb also requiring wizardry but also the addition of some witchcraft.	10	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/548095560dc53
3285	Pet Cemetery	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2772	Sport	60	5.11c	4	The leftmost slab climb on this section of wall before the trail dips. This one doesn't require wizardry or witchcraft, as the two to the right do, but some sort of luck will definitely come in handy.	11	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/556738d341c19
3286	Unmarked Grave	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2773	Sport	60	5.11b	3	This slab is marked by a hueco at arms reach with assist from a pile of cheater stones. Heave up into the hueco to meet a tough mantel move which situates you on the face. A continous series of of tricky moves allows for a break in the middle in a body sized hueco. When the toes are ready for more come out da hole to tiptoe some mo.	12	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554c123dd8c0b
3287	Ghost Dog	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2774	Sport	70	5.11d	1.67	Climb out of a crusty blob and over a low roof for 50 feet of easy climbing corroded white jugs ending at a hard move on sandy holds. Are you enticed?	13	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554c12585447e
3288	Rest in Pieces	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2775	Mixed	80	5.11c	4.5	Mixed line with a single bolt left of Ghost Dog. Gear beta (you may want this): Bring a .4 or yellow Alien and a 2'' cam to protect the moves after the runout on the face. You can also place a .75 immediately below the anchors to reduce leg shake.	14	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/554364237338e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553b07c6950c8
3289	Altered State	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3345	Trad	80	5.11c	4	The obvious steep left-leaning crack between RIP and DOA. Start up on the ledge by scrambling in from below DOA and belay from medium cams. A BD #5 is useful for the top crux but not required.	14	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5577aeb203ac5,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5577aaa62f8b9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5577aa9ac2016
3290	Dead on Arrival	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2695	Sport	60	5.11d	4.73	This is one of the most unique and fascinating lines in its class and offers what may be the steepest and wildest ride you will ever encounter for a route of its grade. Begin on a nice, flat belay ledge and tackle the left-angling line of hand sized pockets leading up to a photo finish anchor clip. Your belayer may get vertigo trying to keep up with exactly which way you are climbing. Another line is bolted left of this route but no details are known at this time.	15	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/556b4343d078e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/545fd4d043a3f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/523748f8c64db

3196	Pig's Nose	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2833	Sport	60	5.11b	2.5	This is the first route encountered when approaching from the right. Scramble up and ride a fat flake for a few moves then cut left. Stab big over the bulge then continue up on the sloping holds that Highlands is known for. Just before the chains you need to trust your instinct and go. It's big, don't worry.	1	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b59f6b412
3197	Sipping Scotch from a Shallow Grave	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2834	Sport	60	5.12a	3.8	This is the beginning of the Highlands 5.12 run. A well defined crux stab near the bottom serves as a great introduction to the cruxy nature of this wall.	2	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b5d0c2daa
3198	Knap of Orkney	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2835	Sport	60	5.12b	4	Begin on a low ledge. A slightly dirty start quickly opens up into challenging cruxes on shallow slopers, small edges, and tight tweakers. If the crux feels impossible try again on a cooler day.	3	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b5fd541f7
3199	Aye Fair to Middlin' (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2836	Sport	70	5.12b	0	This is the fourth line from the right on the main wall. Moderate climbing is quickly put to an end where an evil crux awaits mid-route. If you can break through then fun steep pulling will pump you to the chains. Equipped by Kipp Trummel.	4	31	
3200	Dingwall	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2837	Sport	70	5.12b	4.63	This is probably the best line on the main wall. Begin in a crack and depending on your handjamming skills make an easy or tough move over a low roof. Move up with big pulls on good holds gunning for a crack where the games begin. Shift right over to the crack and follow it with delicate reach throughs and minimal feet to gain a shake. Cut back right to the crack and don't let up until you've made it through the obvious redpoint crux known to thwart many onsite attempts.	5	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379c38e09ea,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379c1f505c6,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536d9d5bab4d3
3201	Skinny Malinky Longlegs	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2838	Sport	65	5.12a	3	The FA isn't known for his route naming skills but he sure can drill them holes. Inconsistent but still a decent line. 5.10 climbing leads to a side-pulling sloper pop off of bad smears to a decent edge. Next dive into the abyss and come out at the chains.	6	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b491427c7
3202	Arthur's Seat	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2839	Trad	65	5.10a	1	Why? Because it's there. The obvious crack on the left side of the wall before the amphitheater.	7	16	
3203	Wide Boys	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2840	Sport	70	5.12b	3.5	This is the last bolted line on the main wall before the amphitheater. A pop move off the ground will get you started on this quality line which will test your squeezers as well as your crimpers. A pump probably won't get you on this one but a couple of moves just might.	8	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379bac411ef,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379b8350ece,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b417e5fea,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a71f5ec7373,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a71ede82def
3204	Blood on the Thistle	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2841	Sport	80	5.12d	4	The first of the four routes in the ampitheater. Climb to a roof at 25 feet and boulder over the roof making use of a sloping edge and a crack to reach good holds. From here move through good underclings to meet up with a blank section of the wall where subtle sloping pinches will let you past if held just right.	9	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b0e8abe37,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b0404a7e6
3205	Nessie	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2842	Sport	80	5.12c	4	Another gut busting roof start puts you onto high quality steep and sustained climbing with a couple of tough deadpoints. A steep start leads to a big undercling move to gain a good horizontal ledge in the roof. Traverse the ledge then reach over the lip for a decent hold to gain the face. Race up on edges and sloping pinches then make a launch to a crimp when the holds fizzle. Consistent crimping takes you to an upper crux where you can go big and dynamic or tiny and static depending on your taste.	10	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b1491ac19,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a720e1e14df,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a71f7b2b6bc
3206	Haggis Nugget	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2844	Sport	80	5.12b	3	Clip the first two bolts of Nessie then head straight over the roof to gain a hand ledge. Fire a deadpoint then climb the steep headwall on medium edges.	10	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553796bb1c46f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553796629ce8f
3207	Bodach	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2843	Sport	80	5.12d	4	On the left side of the amphitheater you will see a large flake in the roof. This and the next line climb up to and out this flake to begin. This route shifts right on bouldery moves to reach a good rest. Move up a bolt then make a full on launch to what couldn't be a bigger and more comfortable jug. Enjoyable 5.11 climbing takes you to the final two bolts where a tough clip and a sloper boulder problem guard the chains.	11	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b1a33c1b2,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7224a38d8e
3208	Tatty Boggler	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2845	Sport	60	5.11b	3.71	This is the first route on the shorter section of wall to the left of the amphitheater. Although it's one of the lower graded routes at the cliff it doesn't serve as a great warmup due to the strenuous moves.	13	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b35b040d8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7203468b2b
3209	Plaid Boys	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2846	Sport	50	5.12a	4.13	The next route left on the ledge routes. Excellent sustained climbing for the first 5 bolts makes for a good warmup. Go further if you feel good but prepare for a beating if you aren't feeling good on really bad holds.	14	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536d9e1ae24aa,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b2a4b3ff5
3210	William Wall Ace	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2847	Sport	50	5.12a	4	The third route from the left side of the wall and also one of the better lines. An awkward start leads to unique boulder problems separated by large plated jugs. A nice little pocket crux may become your close friend as you get acquainted with each other over multiple attempts. Be careful making the 4th clip where a fixed draw takes a little scare out.	15	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/536d9f2ac23a1,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a7b303ba0c2
3211	Puggle Me Self	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2848	Sport	50	5.12b	3	This line has not and may not see many ascents due to being overshadowed by the other quality lines on the wall.

2844	Recovery Room	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2817	Sport	60	5.10b	3.02	This is the rightmost line on the wall at this time. Walk right from where the approach trail meets the cliff. Cross a large ravine and continue to a flat area where several lines begin. Begin on a ten foot high ledge. Climb up to another ledge then pull out onto the well featured orange and black face which kicks back midway for mega-steep jug pulling.	1	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a074739a479

2846	Family History	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2818	Sport	60	5.11a	3.21	Thin plates and pockets lead to a layback after which a scary but solid rest awaits. Pull over a small roof on good pockets to reach the chains.	3	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a074e155f55
2847	Bipolar	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2819	Sport	55	5.11b	3.09	Just right of a crack. Big pockets and edges lead to a roof pull where the angle kicks back and the holds get smaller. Give full effort all the way to the chains.	4	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a075043d624
2848	Zoonotic	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2820	Sport	50	5.10d	1.96	On the left side of the wall before the ravine is a very blunt arete with a set of spook eyes just within reach marking the start of this climb. Begin with three bolts of excellent climbing and end with 5 bolts of un-excellent climbing.	5	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5525f84d90f33,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54dfe3b1653bf
2849	On Bended Knee	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3515	Sport	60	5.11a	3.53	Starts in a dihedral. Power through the steepest part of the route. Get your bearings back in the middle section and enjoy one last technical move to the chains.	6	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/58cffbb046914
2850	Endless Numbered Days	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3545	Sport	45	5.13b	4.86	Mantle onto the ledge to gain the overhanging face. A few moderate moves on good pockets leads to a long sequential boulder problem culminating properly with a mantle.	7	38	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5a3a966ee1778,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5a2f3a9e41b72
2851	Anaphylaxis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3253	Sport	75	5.12c	4.67	Head down the ravine from the previous group of lines to locate this steep, bolted dihedral. Thin tips liebacking and power stemming leads to moderate, fun jug pulling.	8	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5517751e2e834,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/551775127c53b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/550f6325d3dab,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508b97dedfd7
2852	Treponema pallidum	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2821	Sport	80	5.12b	2.75	Left of the bolted dihedral is another line which begins near a built-up sandbox in a swampy section of the trail. A stab to a decent edge gets you started. Another edge stab to get over the roof and then it's a long, steep haul on jugs the rest of the way.	9	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508b9d348766
2853	Quarantine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2822	Sport	80	5.12c	3	The crux of this line is getting off the ground then bouldering around often wet rock for the first two bolts. After which a steep jug haul awaits. If you can catch this one bone dry it may be worth the time. Otherwise move on.	10	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5508ba54a0e7f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5441c2e013424,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/533e29a3c7454

2855	Psych Ward	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3378	Sport	120	5.12d	3.4	Start 40 feet left of Quarantine with a campus off a diagonal flake. 30 feet of bouldery and sometimes delicate climbing brings you to 30 feet of easy slab. Now your work begins with 60 feet of steep, rugged climbing. Equipped by Mike Wheatley. Permadraws on all but the bottom 2 bolts.	12	33	
2856	Last Rites	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3026	Sport	100	5.12b	4.55	Begin on Diminished but cut right to take on what may be one of the steepest and most consistent buckethauls in the Preserve. Spicy runouts near the top provide some additional flavor.	13	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/582d11936e880,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5374c73039911
2857	Diminished Gluteal Syndrome	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3025	Sport	100	5.12d	3.4	Begin as with Last Rights but head directly into the steep cave gunning for the sit-down rests. Pace yourself for the exposed boulder problem before the chains.	14	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5374c716ba65f
2858	Foaming at the Mouth	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3454	Sport	100	5.13a	4.7	Romp up the dihedral to a low crux in the hueco-like feature followed by jugs that go on forever and then another crux at the top. Back-cleaning the first two draws reduces drag.	15	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5ac18b801d04f
2859	Halitosis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3024	Sport	75	5.13a	4	Begins on Push Present but trends right after the first bolt up and into a hueco. A tough boulder problem out of the hueco leads to sustained movement on decent sized holds. Equipped by Andrew Wheatley.	16	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5acbdaa7c425f
2860	Push Present	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2823	Sport	80	5.11d	3.86	The steep arete on the right side of the main wall. If Kaleidoscope is above your head then here's a toned down version for ya. Long, steep, pumpy, and well varied climbing.	17	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5525f7b87ba3e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a0751a21203
2861	Pandemic	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2824	Sport	85	5.12b	3.72	Begin with a big pull over a low roof. Travel through a steep haul on big holds to meet up with a tough boulder problem just before a roof. This route is the only one on this wall that goes over the roof so unlike the others it doesn't stay dry in heavy rain. However, if you can hang onto wet jugs you should be fine.	18	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a07536979f2
2862	Sacbrood Virus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2825	Sport	75	5.12a	3.85	Begin with the same start as Pandemic but trend left to meet up with excellent pocket climbing that will sap you enough to make the final 20 feet worth fighting for.	19	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a075a2da259
2863	Magic Bed	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2826	Sport	70	5.11b	3.71	Pop up to a large expanding ledge and reach over a small bulge to begin. Climb on big holds angling right towards a fat flake. Crawl into a nasty hueco if you dare or skirt the right edge on sandy rock after which you will meet up with a stellar finish making it worth the trip.	20	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/581534daa330e,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5815348eb3497,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5525f79d2b446,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a07551f28ab
2864	Phantom Pain	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2827	Sport	65	5.11c	3.58	Begin with a big move to a nice angled jug. Move up through several flat sections of rock using big pulls on big holds. Surpass a small roof at the top and dig deep at the chains.	21	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/580538569d5bf,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/580536a689886,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5431ddf7e32a7
2865	Typhoid Mary	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3254	Sport	55	5.10a	2.5	This line begins just right of the large boulder on an arete. Climbing to the first set of anchors is 5.10a and to the second set is 5.11d. To the second set is often wet which is why the first set was put in place.	22	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/58153566600e9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564d56cdd2b5a
2866	Typhoid Fever	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3409	Sport	75	5.11d	3	Bouldery 2-bolt extension to Typhoid Mary. You can check conditions in the water streak from the ground.	23	26	
2867	Ebola	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3236	Sport	70	5.12b	4.16	Begin atop the large boulder. A garden variety of jugs and the occasional deep pocket give way to a serious high crux. A periscope may help with the onsite.	24	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564a7ee9e4dec
2868	Brachial Plexus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3215	Sport	80	5.11c	4.32	Begins behind the giant boulder. Phenomenol moves, mega-steep, fat jugs, lots of climbing, and a well defined crux. What more could you ask for in a mid-range 5.11? One of the best in its class.	25	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/551ecbf6b9f0f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/551ecbd5040e5,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d4338483154,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d433535b1db

2870	Trephination	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2828	Sport	85	5.11d	4.24	Excellent! Begin behind the large boulder in a sandy alcove. Pull out on decent slots which continue up the steep face until morphing into phenomenal sloping pinches delivering a wicked pump.	27	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/564d56e049532,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/52a075692c9ae

2872	Triage	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2830	Sport	85	5.12b	3	Begin on a boulder. Seek big edges and pockets angling right and up to a small roof at mid route. After pulling the roof the angle steepens and the pump clock begins.	29	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54499df7aba9a
2873	Pre-Op	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2831	Sport	45	5.10d	3.19	Next route left of Triage. Begin on a high ledge. Not quite the quality of the other 5.10 to the left but still delivers a good pump for the grade. Climb finger pockets to chains just before a small roof.	30	19	
2874	Porphyria	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2832	Sport	60	5.11a	3.8	Second last route on the left and beginning on the high ledge. Pours on the pump enough to make the crux a bit tough but then gives you huge jugs on interesting features to keep the grade down.	31	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5b69d97b50d50
2875	Aquagenic Urticaria	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3306	Sport	45	5.10b	2.58	Furthest bolted line on the left at this time. Begins on the high ledge amd follows a meandering, closed down crack past a bulge and ends with a fight. A great warm up for the wall and guaranteed to stay dry.	32	17	
2876	Malpractice	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3028	Trad	60	5.9	2.5	Starts at the left end of the ledge in the obvious right-facing crack. Climb up under the small roof where the crack turns into a seam and traverse right and up- horizontals provide protection until the crack opens up again. Follow the remaining flakes to chains.	33	12	
2877	Free Clinic	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3546	Sport	50	5.7	2.8		34	6

2879	Hyperbaric Chamber	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3456	Trad	85	5.7	2.33	Start at the triangular cove formed by two slabs and follow the crack above up and left towards a notch at the ledge about 65 feet up. Pull through the notch to a slabby finish with bolted anchors. There are horizontals for gear where the crack disappears in the middle.	36	6	
2880	98.6	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3457	Sport	65	5.10c	1.78	Start on the detached slab left of Hyperbaric Chamber and follow two bolts up to a ledge. Traverse left to reach 3rd bolt and angle up and left to the finish.	37	18	
2881	Scoliosis	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3433	Mixed	100	5.9+	3	Long, dirty and adventurous, this one is worth the effort if you like adventurous trad and scenic topouts. A run-out slab can be eased with tricky gear in horizontals in pockets and long slings.	38	13	
2882	L.A. Branch Office	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3458	Sport	65	5.11a	2.86	Walk uphill along the wall to an archlike feature. Figure out the crux through the bulge and thinner holds to the second and third bolts, then enjoy the slabbier section to the anchors.	39	23	
2883	Platelet Rich Injection	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3459	Sport	55	5.8+	2.86	Up and left 20' from L.A. Branch where a large boulder forms a chimney and dihedral with the wall. You can stem up the dihedral to a jug�left of the first bolt or try a V2/3 boulder problem straight up. Either way leads to an enjoyable slab with big plates near the finish.	40	10	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5747256802733,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/57472540cddfa
2884	Plasma Spill	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3532	Mixed	60	5.6	0	Start the same as Platelet Rich, but head left through the hueco after the first bolt and follow the meandering crack to a tree ledge above with two slung trees for anchors. Bring some longer slings and use a horn along the way.	41	5	
2885	Temperature Rising	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3533	Sport	75	5.8	0	Left of Plasma Spill and just before you get to Cloud 9 is another slab you just can't miss. Figure out the bulge at the 2nd bolt and you'll be hiking the rest.	42	9	
2923	Young Flakenstein	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3103	Sport	60	5.11b	3.21	This thin, bolted flake is located on the far right side of the wall. A tips section for the first ten feet gets you into larger holds for the remainder of the flake. As the flake fades, escape onto the face using small crimps.	1	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5480943de9853
2924	Weird Science	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3104	Sport	70	5.12a	3.75	Just left of Young Flakenstein, if you look hard, is a low, small pocket and a couple of micro-edges. If you can figure out how to solve that puzzle you'll be rewarded with some great, moderate climbing for the rest of the route.	2	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55673998da499,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553badd0a8b95,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553badba85911,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/548094ca9e892
2925	Nikola Tesla	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3105	Sport	80	5.11c	3.8	Chimney up a wide flake to reach a thin tips crack. Exit the comfort of the chimney with a tough gaston move and continue up the face through a stack of tricky moves with sparse feet culminating in a thrutch to a thank-God ear. Tread carefully and choose wisely from the pool of fragile jugs from the last bolt to the chains. You will be severely pissed if you made it this far and a jug breaks.	3	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553bad247e815,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/553bad0cac9cf,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d581f3e0ba1,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5406f31cf1a95
2926	Dyno Project (Project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3106	Sport	60	5.13b	0	Just right of the blunt arete where Micro Array is located is this challenging face climb. Equipped by Shadow Ayala.	4	38	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54b71a32037fa
2927	Micro Array	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3107	Sport	40	5.11c	4	This blunt arete and slab climb may be on the shorter side but the amount of down climbing you do while trying to piece it together will add up to a nice, full pitch.	5	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54809400a0fee
2928	Codie Marie	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3108	Trad	40	5.8	4	The nice, wide dihedral just left of Micro Array.	6	9	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5482864018b4c

Equipped by Shadow Ayala in 2015.	6	33	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5612e4211e2e0
2930	Tittie Twister	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3109	Sport	60	5.12b	1	On the face to the right of the rockhouse is this steeper line of pockets in white sandstone. Although the movement is fun, the rock is fairly soft and poor for the majority of the route. Exiting the overhanging section onto the slab at the top requires some creative hold grabbing and tiny crimp cranking.	7	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/550e22ae1d0bb
2931	Knockout Mouse	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3337	Trad	60	5.10b	3	Begin in the back of the rockhouse and climb out the roof, back cleaning gear along the way to avoid rope drag. Pull the roof and back-clean the last piece(s) from above. Protects very well.

2932	Re-Animator	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3110	Sport	80	5.11b	3.38	The bolted line left of the large rockhouse and wide crack. Begin right of an orange and black flake on a line of pockets which fade, along with the flake, after a small roof. Step back and forth as needed to stem the crack to the right as you discern a series of shallow dishes and the occasional jug. A medium sized cam may settle the nerves from the last bolt to the chains.	8	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408eea899955,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5408ee72d59bd

3142	Rash Decision	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3327	Sport	50	5.11b	2.71	On the ledge above where the trail meets the wall is a slightly overhanging wall with some decent lines. This is the left line and begins with a mantel up to a ledge to reach the first bolt. Sequential moves off the ledge give way to bigger and more forgiving sequences as the pump sets in. Stick clipping the second bolt from the ledge is recommended.	7	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/555146fa0d82e
3143	The Grack	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3519	Sport	60	5.11d	3	Bouldery moves and underclings down low lead to a rest and a mellower finish as the bolts become more spaced.	7	26

Step off the ledge onto a right angling line of large holds which quickly fade to a tough boulder problem where a bit of foot trickery may ease the frustration.	8	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5553b24b0a0ab,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5551476a9af43

Work your way up through some easy ledge climbing to a stance below the first bolt. Moderate climbing on solid edges and pockets takes you to a rest before the roof before the steep headwall. When ready, make a move to gain the roof and get ready to pull hard. Choosing pockets wisely may be the difference between sending or not.	8	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/57fcebfe137f9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/57fcebe8e5ad9,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/57fcebe817da9

2986	Chasing Butterflies	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2681	Sport	70	5.10c	2.43	This slab line begins on the ledge right of The Hairy Caterpillar. Begin with some dirtiness to reach the first bolt where the rock cleans up. Climb the longer than it appears slab peppered with several cruxes that will literally keep you on your toes.	2	18	
2987	Purple Pill	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2696	Sport	65	5.10d	2.5	Begin right of Chasing Butterflies. Climb up to reach a few wrestly moves which will get you over the bulge and onto the face where the crimping begins.	3	19

2989	Free Suckers	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2683	Sport	60	5.11b	3.33	This line takes on the obvious brown streak right of the crack. Begin with a high slimy slot and a tight belay should you pop off. Snatch a good ledge then crank up and onto the face where some great crimping begins. Don't hesitate at the chains, just go big.	5	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5234dd198f3a3
2990	Generic Manufacturer	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2684	Sport	50	5.11d	4	Sometimes you just have to make your own. Begin with a tough boulder problem past a bulge to reach a hand ledge. Move off of the ledge into another difficult section then continue up on excellent stone and through a hueco to an easier finish.	6	26	
2991	Overdose	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2685	Sport	60	5.11c	3.67	Right of Generic Manufacturer is another great line with a cleaner and more mellow beginning. Shares the beginning moves with the following lines but has its own bolts. Pull through the low moves then traverse left on a hand ledge to gain the second bolt. Crank a long pull from a deep horizontal to gain a full pad edge which will take you into stellar moves to the end.	7	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/522c82a01824b

3034	Singularity	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3037	Sport	70	5.12c	4.64	Begin on cheater stones and reach high for the starting holds.

3036	On Thin Ice	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3287	Sport	80	5.12c	3.33	This line begins on the slab on the inside of the left side of the arch. Climb the slab and exit as quickly as possible onto gargantuan grips beneath the steep side of the arch. Unclip your slab bolts to reduce drag then launch into a wild dance through nearly horizontal cave climbing. When you think it can't get any steeper a body length, flat roof with huge incut jugs guards the most difficult move on the route, a hard crank into the chain pod. This route is insane but unfortunately some may be hesitant to yank on the jugs. However, the FA assures us nothing will ever break.	3	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55540953d5980,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55540943a26ba,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55540924e08ed,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379fcf8f65c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55379fa02a05b,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c83ccdef7fa

2950	Linear Regression	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2742	Sport	85	5.11a	4.14	This is the first line encountered when you reach the wall on the main trail from the parking area. It begins on a low rock shelf with about 15 feet of precarious climbing on questionable rock. A high first bolt protects this section after which the rock quality and the movement greatly improve for the remainder of the route.	10	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5352b0f6bec17
2951	Feeding Frenzy	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2744	Mixed	85	5.11b	3.75	As with Linear Regression, a high and tricky to spot bolt protects the initial 15 feet of questionable rock after which a tricky hand and finger crack awaits. Traverse left at the top before entering the hueco, then clip the last bolt of Linear Regression and continue to the shared chain anchor.	11	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d188c417501
2952	Gettin' Woolly	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2743	Sport	80	5.12a	3.88	Begin just right of a large tree. Mellow face climbing leads to a roof at the fourth bolt where the shit gets real. Take the rest before the last bolt because you will need to dig deep to reach the chains.	12	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d188e3b2315,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53ad7a80f3e67
2953	Nachos, Lemonheads, My Dad's Boat	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3387	Sport	75	5.12b	4	A hard boulder problem involving several slopey underclings gains the easy plated face just above the first bolt. Gain a good jug rail just below the fourth then tackle the roof while traversing left and up to another good rest. Hard technical climbing on small crimps and underclings leads to the anchors.	12	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5622902d38575
2954	Sloppy Seconds	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2745	Sport	80	5.11a	3.98	A tricky and thin lower section leads to a great arete run on big holds. A crux guards the chains where two closely spaced bolts will hopefully keep you off the slab if you blow it.	13	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55484b9e91cee,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5352b1fbde20a
2955	Flashback	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2746	Trad	80	5.10c	4.11	This gigantic, intimidating crack splits the middle of the wall. Climb the left side of the huge, layered pyramid feature with excellent gear placements throughout.	14	18	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f0d9090c8d0,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5240e403768f5
2956	Cephalopagus	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2747	Trad	80	5.10b	2.75	Begin on the thin crack and face right of Flashback. Climb the right crack and meet up with Flashback near the top. A large, fallen tree blocks the beginning of this route currently.	15	17	
2957	So What?	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2748	Sport	65	5.11b	3.43	Step up onto a waist high ledge to begin. Solve a tricky, spicy section between bolts 2 and 3 to reach a nice horizontal slot where another tough move awaits. More technical climbing on edges and knobs leads to the chains.	16	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d1891ff3960
2958	Little Wing	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2749	Sport	60	5.9	4.08	Just right of a tree is a large, chalked, flat jug marking the start of this fantastic blunt prow. Definitely one of the better lines in its class.	17	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d82cea8e46,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5352af0e010d7,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53290084c0e06,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5328fde6a41f6
2959	Bees in the Trap	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2750	Sport	80	5.11d	3.86	Begin left of a large crack on a short face that leads to a ledge. Enjoyable plate climbing abruptly ends near the top where the moves get serious. You can't blame this one on the pump. It's recommended to either unclip or put a long draw on the third bolt.	18	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b714cb5ca,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b6e1e8d31,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b6a2dff06
2960	Swole Up	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2751	Trad	80	5.9+	3.25	Dive into the demanding hand to chimney crack right of Bees in the Trap. Leave the Big-Bros behind because a hidden medium cam placement can be found in the chimney section.	19	13	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d1896528732
2961	Leech Line	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2752	Trad	75	5.10	3.14	Start just right of Swole Up in a grungy crack with marginal pro, then traverse right to a hand crack. Climb the hand crack to reach a tree then shift left and continue up the offwidth to the top. Rappel from a tree to descend.	20	15	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/531bd081ac278,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5306a185f04af
2962	Spork	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2753	Mixed	70	5.11b	3.25	From the tree on Leech Line head up the slab protected by four bolts.	21	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d18d7f8530a
2963	Tinkerbell's Panties	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2754	Trad	55	5.9	3.45	Begin atop a group of boulders and enjoy straight-in hand jams coupled with a few face moves.	22	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53f0d97053589
2964	Where the Dope At?	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2755	Sport	50	5.11d	3.14	Great moves on the arete left of a dihedral. Your height, or lack thereof, could break you on this one.	23	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/529d251696a0a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/529d2509df889,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/529d24f7a776c

2966	You Can't Piss on Hospitality	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2981	Sport	45	5.7	3.28	Climb the brown streak, if it's dry, beginning left of a thin seam. Short lived but fun.	24	6	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5352ad0c0e3e0,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53272fa145c2a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/53272f9148f6d
2967	Nilbog Night Life	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3251	Sport	45	5.9	2.9	Climb the slab just right of a deep water groove.	25	12	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54ae0192ef8d3
2968	Little T	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2756	Sport	50	5.11b	3.58	This marginally featured arete may feel several grades harder for the finesse challenged climbers.	26	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5243b7793b92d
2969	American Juggalo	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2757	Sport	50	5.11b	3.07	Don't be fooled by the name, there are no juggalos here. This line marks the start of several challenging slab climbs and the end of comprehensible route names.	27	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5462db059b300
2970	patriotsquestion911.com	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2982	Sport	50	5.11a	2.57	Begins left of a large hueco. A more sustained angle than the bulge laden lines to the right.	28	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d18a2bb41a9
2971	ae911truth.org	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2983	Sport	60	5.10b	3.24	Grab a nice, fat, square flake to get to the first bolt then shift right. Play around in a pair of huecos in the middle of the wall after which the angle kicks back a bit. These route names are cuckoo.	29	17	
2972	Rethink911.org	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2984	Sport	55	5.10b	2.84	Maybe the bolt placements should have been rethought too. Another slab climb with a cuckoo conspiracy theorist name.	30	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54d18a4f5e84a
2973	Rememberbuilding7.org	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2985	Sport	50	5.10b	2.29	The furthest route right at this time and thankfully the last route on the wall with propaganda laden names. Begin on an attached rock platform left of a fat, dirty flake. Probably the least best of the lines on this wall.	31	17	
3292	Reptilian Brain	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2986	Trad	40	5.10a	3.4	As the trail approaches the cliff, this short and steep hand crack can be found right of the main wall hosting the bolted lines.	1	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/549f789cad214,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54793a015d3f6
3293	One Drop	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2759	Sport	65	5.11d	3.33	This is the first bolted route encountered on the main wall and also the less featured. Tweaky moves on small edges and shallow pockets lead to a steeper and more relaxed, though slightly odd, finish.	2	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525c8e7f6098b
3294	Bon Voyage	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3237	Sport	55	5.11d	3.82	Marked by glue-in bolts. This line takes on the golden wall with long reaches between bullet pockets.	3	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55063fbdab087,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5479398079877
3295	Return of the Mohan	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2760	Sport	55	5.11d	4.17	The premier line of the area. The first ascentionist stated it was his best line since Tuskan Raider at Darkside. Fingery climbing on solid rock with just the right amount of holds to keep the grade moderate and the moves remarkable.	4	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5551623700fad,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6917e955c,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d68f87d313,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d68e039ca4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5449a523016c4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525c8fd60b6f0
3296	Rising Hegemon	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2761	Sport	65	5.11b	2.98	Although not the quality of its neighbors, this line serves as a fun warm up for the area. Begin with a few bolts of slightly friable rock to reach better stone above.	5	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5428cfce43e9a
3297	BCL	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3526	Sport	50	5.11a	3.19	Start 10 ft right of Hammer Time. Pockets and jugs lead to enjoyable climbing on the upper arete.	5	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5911ecb6cd64c
3298	Hammer Time	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2762	Sport	70	5.11b	4.16	Just right of a flake leading to a thin seam begins this line. It is marked by a large nose flake feature near the top. A bit of creativity will gain you a no-hands rest here, which you may need for the crux run for the chains. A nearly unavoidable encounter with a big, scary hold awaits at the end.	6	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d685dbd63f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d684401289,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525e9befb1541,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/525c8f1a3accf
3299	Can't Touch This	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3324	Sport	70	5.12b	3	Tackle a low boulder problem that will test your lock off strength as you reach for a high crimp and shorties may find that they can't touch this. Regain your composure and finish the route up on a series of fun yet pumpy roof pulls.	6	31	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5540c394cb39a,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5540c38091cde
3300	Fodiqua	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3005	Sport	80	5.9	3.53	This line takes on the slab in the water streak. Rumor has it this will still be dirty in 3014. Remember though, dirt does not a bad route make.	7	12	
3301	Malignant	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2763	Sport	90	5.11a	3.24	What it lacks in cleanliness it makes up for with length. Thin edges lead to a small roof with a jug where you will probably be for awhile as you scope for holds above. Eventually you will realize there really aren't many so you should probably just quit wasting time and try something.	8	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/546d426b47210,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5428cf4c7055e
3302	Melanoma	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2699	Mixed	85	5.10d	3.17	Begin in the chimney behind the pillar. Continue up the crack and eventually merge with Sundial near the top.	9	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/531fc84ed241c
3303	Sundial	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2698	Sport	80	5.11a	4	A magnificent face climb. Scramble to the top of the pillar with stemming and face holds to begin. Step out onto the face when ready for high quality and technical face climbing. The final section climbs the crack to the right of the last bolt. Clipping is possible with a good side-pull in the crack.	10	23	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d68b77d6c8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6820f40f8,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/552d6809599d4,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/531fcb279b6e8
3304	Dirty Habit	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2697	Sport	85	5.10d	3.17	This line begins just right of the blunt arete near the detached pillar. Due to the runoff expect a layer of dirt but don't let it chase you off! The holds are decent and the movement is great so it can still be a fun ride for a select few.	11	19	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55077f2525529
3305	Dancing Queen	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3021	Sport	60	5.10b	2.79	Left of Dirty Habit is a pair of lines. This climbs the slab with a low crux. Dirty at this time but as with most lines it may clean up to be a decent line given the solidity of the rock.	12	17	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55077b78df863
3306	Linny Lu	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3020	Sport	55	5.10a	2.48	Left of Dancing Queen is another low-angle line that will probably clean up well with age.	13	16	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/55077b3e91b72
3172	The Unfriender	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3273	Sport	70	5.12c	3	A faint trail runs from the road up to Vine Wall meeting the cliff near a long, flat log. This route is left of where the trail meets the wall and begins with an impossible looking first couple of moves. After the start expect great 5.11 face climbing.	1	32	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c9935b45f1f,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c6eecaa8d46
3173	Honey Barbecue	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3432	Sport	110	5.12b	4	Quality sustained face climbing at the bottom leads to a big move before the roof and an easy top out section. Continue to the top on excellent mid-11 face and slab, belay to make it 2 pitches, or descend from here. If linking into one pitch, back-cleaning or extending the 5th bolt (at the dynamic move before the roof) will greatly reduce rope drag. Probably a good idea to pull the rope and descend from the midway anchor if linking both pitches with a 60-meter rope.	1	31	
3174	Poison S	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3274	Sport	50	5.11d	4	Right of a long, flat boulder is this relentless finger burning face climb which will challenge your abilities with shallow pockets, poor feet, and powerful crimping. A steep ending delivers the crux just when you think you have a chance.	2	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c992f819a4a
3175	Bottle Shock	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3275	Sport	40	5.11d	3.56	Begin in front of a boulder with a bad left pocket and a good right if you can reach. Race through a series of bad crimps with even worse feet to a relief jug. When the tips cool down fire to the ledge. Stick clipping the second bolt is recommended.	3	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c992a8ddefc
3176	Undici	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3276	Sport	80	5.11b	3	Around the corner from the vertical wall bordering the trail is a dirty face right of the arete. Pay your dues to reach the upper headwall which looks pretty good from the ground.	4	24	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c99240aef07
3177	Outrunner	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3277	Sport	80	5.11d	0	This is currently the first line on the main overhanging section of Vine Wall. Find a path through the vines to reach it. The first 3/4 of this line is not for the faint of heart but the rock quality improves for the final steep headwall. Equipped by Rob McFall in 2003.	5	26	
3178	Forerunner	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3278	Sport	80	5.11d	0	20 feet right of previous line, left of a small corner, is another line of similar quality. If you liked Outrunner, this one's for you.	6	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a076445e3,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a052282e6,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c991bc14b36
3179	Shogun	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3279	Sport	80	5.11d	0	Begin right of a corner and clip a high first bolt by scrambling up to a 6 foot ledge. 60 feet of terrifying climbing on sandy and fragile rock leads to a steep headwall with long reaches on deep pockets. Ledge fall potential going to the 2nd bolt so it is recommended to hang on the first bolt and stick clip it.	7	26	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c99144efa75
3180	Sweet Berry Wine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3319	Sport	80	5.11c	2.67	Another long adventure up Vine Wall. Consistent climbing trends from left to right with a no-hands at the 4th.	8	25	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5531a0cf1f883
3181	De Vine	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3280	Sport	85	5.12a	4	If you can reach it without getting swallowed up by the ground, there's another route further down the wall. Large but friable holds improve in quality as the line reaches a steep, upper corner of sorts. Begins with a first bolt on the immediate left side of a corner.	9	30	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/54c993d2d3031
3182	Highway to Hell	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3283	Sport	100	5.13a	4	Paw through ivy to gain a ledge where this route begins. A difficult beginning with poor feet eases up to a short but pumpy run to a sandy ledge where an initial set of anchors are located. Bail here for 5.11c or continue up through a section of extreme choss and sand to reach the beginning of an insanely good pumpfest that makes up for all the low quality rock surrounding it. Equipped by Kevin Cox and Mike Wheatley. The upper pitch of this route is well worth the trip.	10	37	http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a0c4588dd,http://redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/phpThumb.php?src=img/5537a0b086df2
3183	Citizen Four (Closed project)	https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=3353	Sport	110	5.13	0	Begin just right of Highway to Hell. A bouldery start opens up to larger holds to reach an overhanging flake. Exit the flake to tackle a 60 degree roof which ends with a runout on deep slots to the chains. Equipped by Ray Ellington.	10	36
