To get to the routes, either bushwhack straight up to the cliff from the field or hike the road. For the latter option, stay on the muddy road to the backside of Raven, then walk up the deteriorated paved section. Continue along the switchbacks past an old gate until you near the top. When you reach a sharp right turn and the main face of Raven is on your left about 100 feet away, contour left to the rock. Wall Sun: Morning",

Immediately turn right and follow a dirt road for about 150 yards or so until it begins to go uphill. In that vicinity you'll see what appears to be a three way fork. Continue uphill on the main trail via the left fork. After 200 yards, you will pass a huge spire on the right.

This road continues level along the hillside for some distance before turning uphill through a gap in the lower cliff band. After passing through the lower cliff band, head left to the point of rock and locate the first route (Brighton Rock 5.7) on the east face. To get to Brighton Rock from Willie's Wall, just go to the left end of Willie's Wall and around the corner. A short hike (a few hundred feet)through the woods will get you there. Hike directly to the next buttress, staying well downhill from the chossy cliffline that seperates the two buttresses.Wall Sun: Unknown",

The gravel road changes to asphalt at the Menifee and Powell county line. About a mile farther is a farmhouse and barn on the left and a gravel road on the right (Forest Service Road 9). Turn down that road and proceed 1.1 miles and cross a bridge. This brings you to the intersection of 9A and 9B. Turn right on 9B and drive 2.9 miles to a low concrete bridge which crosses the East fork of Indian Creek. Park on the right before you cross the bridge and hike across the road to a jeep trail. Follow the jeep trail until you reach a tributary. Cross the tributary twice and continue on the trail keeping the tributary on your left. Eventually the trail will cut sharply uphill to the right. Continue on the trail which eventually terminates at a horseshoe shaped wall. Walk left past a huge amphitheatre housing two currently closed routes. Continue walking left to reach routes 1-7.

Park before the crossing(or park at Purple Valley and walk back up the road), and locate a ridge on the right(Southeast) which terminates in a steep slope 300 feet before the crossing. Bushwhack up the ridge(beware of stinging nettles in the Summer) to a plateau, then angle slightly left and continue on a faint logging road along a saddle toward the main cliff.

Continue in the same direction as the road making use of a trail on your right to avoid crossing the stream. Cross the stream when you have to about 300 feet from the parking area. Just before you are forced to cross again, look for a tributary known as Amos Creek on your left. Leave the road, cross Amos Creek, and walk north (to the right) up a steep ridge through a limestone band to a buttress. You will see a wide crack (Quality Crack) in the middle of the wall at this point. Wall Sun: Unknown",

The gravel road changes to asphalt at the Menifee and Powell county line. About a mile farther is a farmhouse and barn on the left and a gravel road on the right (Forest Service Road 9). Turn down that road and proceed 1.1 miles and cross a bridge. This brings you to the intersection of 9A and 9B. Turn right on 9B and drive 2.9 miles to a low concrete bridge which crosses the East fork of Indian Creek. Drive across the bridge and park immediately on the right near a Forest Service gate. Hike .75 miles east down the meandering logging road until it veers left and uphill and finally fades out. A massive pinnacle, easily visible in the Winter, is on your left (to the north and west) as the road curves around it. When the road becomes obscure, bushwhack toward the pinnacle until you can discern a saddle between its north side and the main cliff. If you followed directions closely, the saddle should be on the right as you approach the pinnacle. Follow the saddle right (north) to its bisection with the nearby wall, then walk left (west) 300 feet to the first climb, Spider Wand. Wall Sun: Unknown",

Immediately turn right and follow a dirt road for about 150 yards or so and look for a trail that ducks off to the left. Take this trail uphill and eventually you'll wind up back on the logging road. Follow this road until it levels out. Ignore the first road that branches off uphill to the right. Follow the road as it switches back to the right. After you cross a couple of \"speed bumps\" going uphill, leave the road for a trail that heads off to the left and uphill. Follow this faint trail which will probably bring you up directly beneath the huge roof of Close Encounters With a Wench. Wall Sun: Unknown.",

The gravel road changes to asphalt at the Menifee and Powell county line. About a mile farther is a farmhouse and barn on the left and a gravel road on the right (Forest Service Road 9). Turn down that road and proceed 1.1 miles and cross a bridge. This brings you to the intersection of 9A and 9B. Park on your right and hike down 9B about 150 feet until you see the trailhead on your left. Follow the trail through a low limestone cliffband until you reach the base of the wall.

Be respectful.\n\n\nDrive to the very end of 9b which is 0.1 miles past the crossing near the parking for Indian Creek Crag (3.9 miles from the 9a/9b intersection). You will pass a road, which is blocked by a gate on the right, that leads to Board Wall. Either park at the very end of the road and risk getting blocked in, or park at a small turnout on the left just before the end. On the right(Northest) side of the road, across from the turnout, is a flat grassy area popular with campers. Walk to that area, then turn right and follow a faint path across a muddy rivulet to the base of a more recent logging road. Turn left and head up the muddy road until you near the wall. The large detached area of rock on the left is the location of \"A Way of Life\", \"Delusions of Grandeur\", and all climbs in between. At the point this detached area bisects the main cliff near an arete is where \"Captain One Eye\" can be found. Climbs on the right side of the detached block and those eastward are described first, then the left side of the detached block and climbs to its west are listed. Wall Sun: Unknown",

Turn left (east) and continue for\n1.5 miles, then turn right (north) on\nKY 77. This highway is also known as\n\"Nada Tunnel Road\", and you\nmay see a street sign so designated at\nthis intersection. Drive 4.4 miles through the tiny town of Nada, through the tunnel, and over the steel bridge (stay right after you cross the steel bridge) to the intersection with KY 715. KY 77 curves left near an old barn while KY 715 continues straight. Follow KY 77 around to the left, past the barn on the right and uphill for 0.3 miles to an available pulloff on the right. The trail begins across the road from the third pulloff. Follow the trail uphill to the base of Fortress Wall. You will pass Party Time on the way so do not hike too far if you plan on doing this route. Wall Sun: All day",

Turn left (east) and continue for 1.5 miles, then turn right (north) on KY 77. This highway is also known as \"Nada Tunnel Road\", and you may see a street sign so designated at this intersection. Drive 4.4 miles through the tiny town of Nada, through the tunnel, and over the steel bridge (stay right after you cross the steel bridge) to the intersection with KY 715.  Stay to the left on KY 77 (KY 715 curves to the right) towards Fortress Wall and Phantasia.  Stay on KY 77 for about 8 miles until you see Flecher Ridge road on your right.  The road angles sharply back to the right.  Turn right on this road and drive for about 1.3 miles.  Look for Forest Service signs on your left.  Shortly after you see the Forest Service signs on your left, look for a field directly after the wooded section ends.  Park on your left and hike along the field keeping the wooded section on your left.  You will be following an old barbed wire fence.  After about 10 minutes the field will meet up with a wooded area.  Continue on a trail through the woods, angling slightly left, until you reach the cliff's edge.  Head left and look for an obvious dark and narrow corridor heading down to the base of the cliff.  Continue down through the corridor and hike down to a creek.  Cross the creek and head uphill to the base of the wall which the routes listed in this guide are on.  You should come out of the rhodos somewhere near Laceration.Wall Sun: Unknown",

KY 77 curves left near an old\nbarn while KY 715 continues straight.\nStay on KY 715 (do not take the curve\nto the left) for about 6.7 miles (0.5 miles past the pulloff for Upper Small Wall) until you see a pulloff on the right near a large boulder in the river. Cross the river and look head upstream a bit along the bank until you see a faint trail. Follow the trail to a drainage then head up to the wall.\nAn alternate approach is to keep driving on 715 for another half mile to a one lane concrete bridge which crosses the Red River. Cross the bridge and park in the parking area on the left. Walk across the road and down to the river bank. Follow the river downstream for about a half mile. After the river bends to the right, look for the bright orange wall of Hen's Nest on your left. Follow the river a bit more then head up to the wall near a drainage. Wall Sun: Unknown",

Pinch-em Tight Ridge is the large wall across the river to the southeast. From the parking area, walk downstream along the river to a ford and cross. It is also possible to hike upstream until you reach a pedestrian bridge to cross but this will add a 1/2 hour onto the approach time. The river crossing is usually pretty high during the winter and spring but lower the rest of the year. From the crossing, hike uphill to the right heading for the wall. There is a tall rockhouse a few hundred feet north of Pinch-em Tight Gap which is used as a reference for some of the routes.

Park in the pulloff and walk back down the road for about 150 feet to the trailhead for Tower Rock. You may see a sign indicating this. Walk across the road and take the winding trail uphill to a sharp bend near a large boulder. Just past the boulder, to the left, is a faint trail which will take you to Crankenstein, Courtesy Cringe and The Cutting Board. To get to the other routes and to the main part of Tower, stay on the trail. When the trail forks, take the right fork through a hallway of sorts to the nearest end of the rock (north facing).

Cross a large bridge and park on your left after the bridge. If you look upstream of Wolfpen Creek, you can see the striking orange wall of Wolfpen Wall. There are two ways to approach the wall. The first approach involves more bushwhacking but is a better way to get to Wishbone. Hike upstream towards Wolfpen Wall then angle up right to a ridge. Walk left along the ridge through some large boulders to the base of Wolfpen Wall. Another way to approach the wall involves hiking up Wolfpen Creek for about 15 minutes until you cross a large fallen tree. Look for a pile of rocks on your right then hike uphill to the wall.

Park in the pulloff and hike back towards the bridge for about 300 feet and look for a trail on the on the left(north) side of the road.  Take the trail up to the wall.\r\n\r\nAn alternate approach from the Rest Area in slade is to jump back on Mountain Parkway and head east to the next exit (Exit 40).  Turn right off the exit on KY 15 and drive 0.7 miles through the town of Pineville. Turn right onto 715 and drive 5.6 miles along the road.  Be sure to stay on the road when it takes a hairpin turn to the right or you will end up at the Sky Bridge Ridge parking area for the tourist trail.  After the sharp turn to the right and then left, the road will head sharply downhill passing a large pulloff on your right (Funk Rock City).  When the road levels out you will see another pulloff on your right.  That is the parking for Eastern and Western Sky Bridge Ridge.  Wall Sun: Unknown",

Turn left (east) and continue for\r\n1.5 miles, then turn right (north) on\r\nKY 77. This highway is also known as\r\n\"Nada Tunnel Road\", and you\r\nmay see a street sign so designated at\r\nthis intersection. Drive 4.4 miles\r\nthrough the tiny town of Nada, through\r\nthe tunnel, and over the steel bridge\r\n(stay right after you cross the steel\r\nbridge) to the intersection with KY\r\n715. KY 77 curves left near an old\r\nbarn while KY 715 continues straight.\r\nStay on KY 715 (do not take the curve\r\nto the left) for about 7.8 miles and\r\naround a sharp bend to the left. About\r\n.5 miles past the sharp bend you will\r\nsee a large pulloff on your left. Drive past this pulloff until you see an even larger pulloff on the left with a closed off dirt road.  Park here and walk the road 0.6 miles to a crossing over Swift Camp Creek.  The crossing may nor may not have some stepping stones.  Wade the creek and walk upstream along an old road for 200 feet to locate an approach trail on your left which winds uphill to the wall.\r\n\r\nAn alternate approach from the Rest\r\nArea in slade is to jump back on\r\nMountain Parkway and head east to the\r\nnext exit (Exit 40). Turn right off\r\nthe exit on KY 15 and drive 0.7 miles\r\nthrough the town of Pineville. Turn\r\nright onto 715 and drive 5.5 miles\r\nalong the road. Be sure to stay on the\r\nroad when it takes a hairpin turn to\r\nthe right or you will end up at the Sky\r\nBridge Ridge parking area for the\r\ntourist trail. After the sharp turn to\r\nthe right and then left, the road will\r\nhead sharply downhill.  Look for a large pulloff on your right before the road levels out.Wall Sun: All day",

Turn right into a large\ncamping area with some shelters,\ngarbage cans and a dumpster.\nPark and walk back through the campsite area toward the stream. Cross the stream at a bend where it is shallow and continue on the faint trail for 150 feet until you see a tributary on your right.

Turn right on KY 498. Drive 1.2 miles to a sharp right curve. Just beyond this curve, and at the crest of the hill, take a sharp right on Bald Rock Road (gravel road). There is a sign for a church here. The road will immediately fork left near a trailer. Take this left fork. Follow the gravel road 1.65 miles to a set of 3 entranceways on the right (about 0.1 miles past a road leading uphill to the right just past Bob Marley Crag). Take the second of the 3 entranceways. This is the last road you can take off to the right. If you were to pass this road you will come to a dead-end/turnaround in about 200 yards. Turn up the road and stay on it until you come to a fork in the road. Take the left fork and head up a steep hill. At the top of the hill, the road will curve sharply to the left. Stay on the road, passing a pond on your left, and continue up another steep hill. Continue past the road to Oil Crack Rock and stay on the same road. Locate a pulloff on your left which marks the first parking area. It is best to park here if you're headed for the 5.10 wall (routes #1-#4). If you're headed for the 5.11 wall (routes #16-#19) you may want to continue on the road a bit. Eventually you will come to a sharp left turn and a small steep hill. At the top of this hill and to the right is the second parking area for The Arena. Wall Sun: All day.",

Sign required waivers.\n\n\nYou could wait in line to climb at the Motherlode or get on equally good 5.12s and 5.13s at the adjacent Bear's Den. The Bear's Den is broken into sectors with the Gold Wall and Steep Wall on the left side getting sun for most of the day and the Twelve Wall, Cut Tree Wall, and Project Wall on the right side in the shade. Park in the Motherlode parking area. Hike the Motherlode trail taking the right path as if going to the Undertow Wall side. At the top of the steep mud hill there will be a faint trail that leads to your right. After a few minutes on this trail you will come to the first of several trails angling uphill to the left. This first uphill trail takes you to the leftmost route, Tar Baby, on the Gold Wall. The second trail uphill takes you to Golden Snow Cone. The third trail uphill takes you to Gandee Candy and the last part of the Gold Wall hosting several 5.12s. Continue on the main trail a few more minutes stepping over a drainage gap and look for a trail leading up to the left that takes you to the Steep Wall which hosts numerous 100-foot long quality 5.13s. To get to the right side of the Bear's Den there is a trail angling down to the right directly across from the third trail that angles up to the left. Follow this trail down and step over a stream/drainage and follow a trail going up left on an old logging road. After a minute on this logging road follow the trail up right to the Cut Tree Wall where there is a large tree stump with 3 bolted routes on it. To the left of this wall is the Twelve Wall and to the right is the Project Wall. The routes on the right side of the Bear's Den are good quality but will need some cleaning so bring a brush.Wall Sun: Sun/Shade",

Sign required waivers.\n\n\nPark in the Motherlode parking area and walk down the road toward Sore Heel Hollow parking area until you see a dirt road on the right. Walk up the dirt road until it turns right (100 yds), don't follow the road but continue straight onto a path that will lead directly to the Chocolate Factory. Hiking time is approximately 5-7 minutes from the Motherlode parking area. To reach Wobbler and the routes right of it take the left logging road visible shortly before you reach the cliff. To reach Peaches and Cream and the routes right of it do not take the first left logging road. Stay on the trail for about 50 more feet until you see a cliff visible just up on the left with a short trail leading to it.Wall Sun: Unknown",

You will pass Roadside and Torrent on the way. Turn right on Fixer Rd and make your first left. Take that road for 3.5 miles (making sure not to turn left where the road seems to want to take you) until you see a black oil tank on your left with a face painted on it. Make a right at the oil tank and then take the second right. Drive down a hill and park just to the right of a steep road that branches left. The main parking area is located here near the kiosk for the Pendergrass-Murray Recreational Preserve. From the parking area, walk a few feet past the kiosk to locate the trail marker. Follow the trail down and across a small bridge then along a dirt road for a a short distance. Take the first right on an old oil/logging road. Follow this for around 75 yards then continue left on the road at the fork. Take this to an old oil rig. Behind this the road forks again, take the left fork and follow it around until you can see the cliff. To reach the first routes, look for a trail branching off and uphill on the left. For A1A and the routes right of it remain on the road a bit longer, passing another old oil pump, then head uphill to the cliff. Wall Sun: Morning to early afternoon",

Be respectful.\n\n\nCurbside is a very accessible wall bordering the left side of the road on the way to the main Sore Heel Hollow parking area for The Gallery, Volunteer Wall, etc. The trail is located .5 miles from the turnoff onto the road leading to the parking area 50 feet behind an oil pump just before the main road turns sharply to the right and heads downhill to the main parking area. Follow the trail for a couple of minutes to reach the main wall. Most of the routes stay dry in the rain. Routes 1-4 are best accessed by walking back toward the way you drove in until you reach another oil pump on the right side (your left side if you are walking back from the original trail) of the road.

You will pass Roadside and Torrent on the way. Turn right on Fixer Rd and make your first left. Take that road for 3.5 miles (making sure not to turn left where the road seems to want to take you) until you see a black oil tank on your left with a face painted on it. Make a right at the oil tank and then take the second right. Drive down a hill and park just to the right of a steep road that branches left. The main parking area is located here near the kiosk for the Pendergrass-Murray Recreational Preserve. From the parking area, walk a few feet past the kiosk to locate the trail marker. Follow the trail down and across a small bridge then along a dirt road for a few hundred yards until it heads off into the woods. Stay on the trail until it branches off to the right. You will see signs pointing the direction to the Solar Collector and The Darkside. Taking a right and heading uphill will take you to the Solar Collector. If you continue straight on the trail, it will take you to The Darkside. Wall Sun: Late afternoon",

Turn right on KY 498 and follow for 1.2 miles to Bald Fork Road. Take a sharp right onto Bald Fork Road and follow it as it curves left toward a house. Do not turn right at the first fork. After 0.3 miles the road turns to gravel and heads down a steep hill. At the bottom of the hill you will pass the parking area on the right for The Motherlode. Remain on the road for a total of 1.4 miles (0.6 miles past the Motherlode parking) until you see a wooden sign indicating the RRGCC parking area on the left. Park here and walk back out to the road. Turn left onto Bald Fork Road and follow it for about 100 feet to the next dirt road on the right. Hike up the dirt road until it intersects with another road and turn right. Hike this road uphill for about 7 minutes (do not turn left on the next road) until it curves around to the right. About 100 feet after the road curves to the right look for a small wooden ladder on the left which leads up a short hill and ends directly beneath Check Your Grip and Whipper Snapper.

Turn right onto the winding KY 1036 and drive 2.0 miles. Just after a fenced-in oil drilling yard, you will see Big Bend Road. Continue past Big Bend Road for 0.1 miles to Sun Oil Company parking lot. On its right side, near the road, is a very steep gravel road. Drive 0.4 miles down the road (ignoring the turnoffs) to an obvious cliff on the right with a spacious pullout.Wall Sun: Afternoon sun",

Turn right on KY 498. Drive 1.2 miles to a sharp right curve. Just beyond this curve, and at the crest of the hill, take a sharp right on Bald Rock Road (gravel road). There is a sign for a church here. The road will immediately fork left near a trailer. Take this left fork. Follow the gravel road 1.65 miles to a set of 3 entranceways on the right (about 0.1 miles past a road leading uphill to the right just past Bob Marley Crag). Take the second of the 3 entranceways. This is the last road you can take off to the right. If you were to pass this road you will come to a dead-end/turnaround in about 200 yards. Turn up the road and stay on it until you come to a fork in the road. Take the left fork and head up a steep hill. At the top of the hill, the road will curve sharply to the left. Stay on the road, passing a pond on your left, and continue up another steep hill. The road to Oil Crack Rock is directly to the right at the top of the hill. Most people back in here to make it easier to exit. Travel down this road for about 1/4 mile until you reach an oil well near a small parking area.\nParking is a bit tight here so be sure to leave as much room as possible for others. Be sure not to block any wells when you park. Wall Sun: Unknown.",

After 0.3 miles the road turns to gravel and heads down a steep hill to a clearing at the bottom (0.8 miles from the beginning of Bald Fork Road). Park on your right in the Motherlode parking area or continue by turning right on the first gravel road .3 miles past the Motherlode parking area. There is a �Sore Heel Parking,� sign located at the turn off pointing the way. Follow the gravel road up the hill past a row of large bright blue storage tanks, make a sharp right-hand turn (.2 mile after turn off), follow the main gravel road for another � mile before following the road down a short hill to the new parking area at the bottom of the hill on the right.\nLook for new trailhead signs pointing to the climbing areas along a (freshly cleared) dirt road leading up a hill from the parking area The first route encountered on this wall is Red Rover.

You will pass Roadside and Torrent on the way. Turn right on Fixer Rd and make your first left. Take that road for 3.5 miles (making sure not to turn left where the road seems to want to take you) until you see a black oil tank on your left with a face painted on it. Make a right at the oil tank and then take the second right. Drive down a hill and park just to the right of a steep road that branches left. The main parking area is located here near the kiosk for the Pendergrass-Murray Recreational Preserve. From the parking area, walk a few feet past the kiosk to locate the trail marker. Follow the trail down and across a small bridge then along a dirt road for a few hundred yards until it heads off into the woods. Stay on the trail until it branches off to the right. You will see signs pointing the direction to the Solar Collector and The Darkside. Taking a right and heading uphill will take you to the Solar Collector. If you continue straight on the trail, it will take you to The Darkside. Wall Sun: Unknown",

      "directions": "Directions to Soul Canyon\n\nThis wall is in Private property. Be respectful. Your behavior on this land can either help us secure access.. or help us lose it.\n\n\nTurn off 11 onto Fixer Road as if driving to Coal Bank Holler. Exactly 2 miles after you leave 11, a small dirt pullout will appear on the left side of Fixer. Park here as efficiently as possible and do NOT block the gate. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 2-3 CARS PARKED HERE ALREADY, DO NOT PARK HERE! CONTINUE ON FIXER TO COAL BANK OR ANOTHER CRAG. This small parking area is managed by the Kentucky Fish & Wildlife Department as part of the Ashland Wildlife Management Area, and as such it is sometimes shared with hunters and/or campers during open hunting season. Please be sensitive to this by not overcrowding the lot on busy fall weekends and NOT BLOCKING THE GATE.\nFrom the cross parking area, cross Fixer Rd. and walk about 50 yards further down the road (to your left). A grassy trail will appear on your right. Hike this trail for 5-7 minutes through several meadows, after which time the trail will start trending left and downhill. Drop down through a small, steep notch in the cliffband with a couple of fixed ropes. Turn back to you left on the flat trail (old oil road) and continue another minute to the start of the climbing. The first route you will encounter is Soul Crack (5.7) on the left. This crag tends to condense in humid weather and is best saved for nice dry conditions.\nOther proposed directions include: Bushwhack through the random woods to the magical notch in the cliff that you can't see. ;)Wall Sun: Afternoon",

Your behavior on this land can either help us secure access.. or help us lose it.\n\n\nThis crag is best approached by taking the trail that is midway down the Motherlode Hill, just downhill of the obvious pocketed wall. Continue past the Unlode on the logging trail and at the end it will gradually cut up the hill to right. As you come over the top of the hill you will see a large amphitheater. The line directly in front of the trail is Hippie Core Drill Machine. To get to the moderates walk left around the cave and turn the corner to the right to find the wall.\nAlternatively, you can walk in from the trail at the back of the large Motherlode parking lot, that is to the right of the new Motherlode/Bears Den trail. Take this trail to just before you cross the stream, and cut sharply right back up a trail that heads up the hill that is on your right as you walk in. Once at the top, this trail joins an old logging road where you cut back left. A few minutes walk from here will put you in view of the amphitheater of South Park.\nRoutes are listed from left to right but you walk in more on the right side.Wall Sun: Morning",

Turn right on KY 498 and follow for 1.2 miles to Bald Fork Road. Take a sharp right onto Bald Fork Road and follow it as it curves left toward a house. Do not turn right at the first fork. After 0.3 miles the road turns to gravel and heads down a steep hill. Go past the Motherlode parking area. Pass the road to the Sore Heel parking area on your right at .3 miles, then take a left turn that comes up almost immediately. The first right off of this road puts you in the new Flat Hollow parking area. From the parking area facing the hollow, walk up the road to the right, passing the multi-use trails on the left that provide access to other walls and great mountain biking. When you get to a clearing where an oil pump used to be, switchback to the left to get on the trail. In less than 5 minutes you should come to the wall beneath Birth of Legend, with the massive hemlock and pretty dihedral of Do the Hemlock Rock to your left. Wall Sun: Morning",

In two more minutes you should come to the wall underneath On Beyond Velodrome, with it�s large hueco about halfway up the wall. Most of the crag faces west to northwest, and gets morning shade. Nothing stays dry in more than a light rain.\nVelo Pinnacles: To get to routes one and two, look for a rough trail that cuts down left and away from the wall in the vicinity of Ultegra. Contour around the pinnacles until you go right and squeeze through a small gap in the rock. Scramble through a few more squeezes between boulders until you find the bolts of Lighting Rod Arete. Old People Are Awesome is around the corner and to the left, in the big chimney where the two pinnacles touch. Wall Sun: Afternoon sun",

Please visit www.muirvalley.com for complete details pertaining to the location of the property. Please respect the landowners' rules by completing a release form available at www.muirvalley.com/release.html before climbing on the land. The directions below begin from the parking area for Muir Valley. The directions to the parking area have been left out to promote a visit to www.muirvalley.com to understand the details of climbing on the property. To reach the routes located at Rebel Branch Hollow, turn right into the first parking area. Follow a steep foot path to the valley floor. Cross the creek and go past the first trail on the left (which goes to Joe Ponder Branch Hollow) and continue on to the next obvious trail to the left. The first wall you come up to at Rebel Branch Hollow is the Bruise Bros Wall. To get to Sunnyside: About 50 yards up the hill to Rebel Branch locate a trail branching across the valley to the right. Follow this for ~300 ft then it will drop down into the clearing. From here veer left over a log bridge then up a short hill. Next follow the obvious path right along the cliff. \"Route #24 \"Rat Stew\" is the last route on the Bruisebrothers Wall (for now), the rest of the routes are on the other side of the hollow at Sunnyside. There are now signs that mark the trail to Sunnyside.\" --J-Rock. Routes are listed from left to right. Wall Sun: All day",

Follow that road about 100 feet to a creek crossing and continue along a grassy road for about 5 minutes keeping the creek to your left. When the road turns sharply to the right, continue a few minutes longer until you see two wooden signs on a tree pointing to The Solarium and The Great Wall near an obvious stream crossing on the right. To reach The Great Wall, turn right and cross the stream then continue through a swampy area (with boardwalks) along the trail as it winds uphill to the wall.

This wall is on the south side of Hatton Hollow directly across the creek from the Bowling Alley.  It can be reached via an old logging road located near the mouth of the hollow.  Follow the logging road up and right into the south side of the hollow (if you mistakingly take the logging road that goes up and left to the north side then you will soon be at the heavily pocketed Bowling Alley).  Once you reach the cliffline go to the climbers left to locate the routes.  The recommended approach is to wade the creek into the entrance of Hatton Hollow. Wall Sun: Late afternoon",

The directions to the parking area have been left out to promote a visit to www.muirvalley.com to understand the details of climbing on the property. To reach the routes located at Rebel Branch Hollow, turn right into the first parking area. Follow a steep foot path to the valley floor. Cross the creek and go past the first trail on the left (which goes to Joe Ponder Branch Hollow) and continue on to the next obvious trail to the left. The first wall you come up to at Rebel Branch Hollow is the Bruise Bros Wall. To get to Sunnyside: About 50 yards up the hill to Rebel Branch locate a trail branching across the valley to the right. Follow this for ~300 ft then it will drop down into the clearing. From here veer left over a log bridge then up a short hill. Next follow the obvious path right along the cliff. \"Route #24 \"Rat Stew\" is the last route on the Bruisebrothers Wall (for now), the rest of the routes are on the other side of the hollow at Sunnyside.

Be respectful.\n\n\nFrom the main parking area cross Hell creek using the footbridge and follow the road past two main turnoffs on the left, the second of which leads to the Bowman Fork climbing areas. Continue along the main road, passing a narrow dirt road on the left which is the trail for Chaos. Shortly after that you will see a short road on the right which is the trailhead for Highlands. Almost directly across from this is a wider road than the one leading to Chaos which angles uphill to the left. This is the road you want to follow to reach Alcatraz. Follow the road until you see an obvious very steep pocketed wall beginning on a wide ledge about 4 feet up. That is the Power Grid section of Chaos wall. Continue along the road and shortly you will locate a steep trail leading straight to the short and striking line, Silent Circle, which marks the beginning of Alcatraz. Wall Sun: Shade",

The rock is high quality and varies from vertical to slightly overhanging with some sections such as the Power Grid clocking in at steep. As with most north facing cliffs in the Red the rock can be covered in powdery lichen so bring a brush. From Serenity Point walk right along the trail until reaching a point where it heads downhill skirting the cliff. Chaos begins with the first cluster of routes on a vertical wall capped by a high roof where Live with a Curse can be found. It's also possible to reach Chaos without walking up the trail to Coopers Cove and Serenity Point. To approach this way continue walking along the main dirt road as if going to Highlands or Fruit Wall. Eventually an old logging road angles uphill to the left. Follow this road which branches to a trail leading uphill and ending just beneath Mike Mulligan. The wall faces north to northeast. 37.6417N -83.6802 WWall Sun: Shade",

Be respectful.\n\n\nHighlands offers exceptional and unique climbing for the Red in that the routes tend to be more cruxy in nature than pumpy. That's not to say that you won't suffer a tremendous forearm flame out here though. Bring a brush since the routes may still have a fine layer of powdery lichen. The stone is grey and solid and the holds tend to be subtle sloping pinches and underclings. From the main parking area cross the creek and walk the road passing two roads on the left. Continue without turning down either of these roads until reaching a short road on the right. There is a large boulder adjacent to the end of this short road. Turn down the road and follow it for about 100 feet then take a trail on the right which crosses a stream. Continue along the trail for about 10 minutes, crossing the stream six more times for a total of seven crossings. Just before the eighth crossing look for a faint trail on the right which winds uphill meeting up with the cliff just right of Highlands. Just around the corner to the left is the first route on the right side of the main wall. The wall faces west to northwest receiving afternoon sun but has enough tree coverage to keep it cool in the warmer months. Latitude 37.679722, Longitude -83.676667 Wall Sun: Afternoon",

This and Cooper's Cove could easily be 5.11 heaven in anyone's book. The wall faces south to southeast.\nFrom the main parking area cross the creek and walk down the road until reaching the second road on the left. Walk down this road, passing the obvious trailhead on the right leading to Serenity Point, until reaching a road on the right which crosses a creek. This road is marked by a muddy parking area just before the main road angles right and continues uphill to the Deep End.

Continue without turning down either of these roads until reaching a short road on the right. There is a large boulder adjacent to the end of this short road. Turn down the road and follow it for about 100 feet then take a trail on the right which crosses a stream. After the stream, heading left will lead to Highlands but continuing straight toward some oil ruins will lead to an old road. Follow the road uphill toward the East for a few minutes until reaching an obvious concave South facing wall hosting a few bolted lines.

Cross the creek and walk uphill for about five minutes until the road flattens. As the road becomes steep again and more narrow look for the Fruit Wall trail to the left, and keep hiking about 15 minutes past that. Also hike past The Portal and Poison Ivy wall to a trail on your left going uphill to another logging road. Hike this road to another trail on your left, then walk right when you meet the wall to find the routes. (About 30 minutes from the parking lot at the end of Hell Creek Road.)Wall Sun:",

Be respectful.\n\n\nIn short: Take the low trail directly to Cloud 9 along Bowman Fork, but branch left after crossing the creek up a steep and often muddy old oil road. Follow this road to the end to arrive at routes 8-10.\nDetailed: From the Miller Fork main parking area, cross the creek on the foot bridge to the right. Immediately change to the left of the road to take a trail that leads to the Bowman Fork Road. Take a left toward the Serenity Point trailhead, then stay on the road as it veers left, crosses a creek, then veers right. At this point cross the creek again heading west by northwest onto an old logging road; follow this past the trailhead for The Infirmary. The road breaks down while following a creek; approximately 650 feet past the Infirmary trailhead is an old oil company road that goes up a steep hill. As you follow the road up, you will notice the main project wall of the Real Deep End on your left with a striking offwidth crack in a left facing dihedral. (To the climber's left of the OW crack find three long impressive lines, routes 3-5.) The road meets the wall (37.64069, -83.68550) near a swampy area and set of pumpy 5.11s that begins on an arete at left (Valsalva Maneuver); continue right for routes 26-34 or left for routes 1-22. Follow this road to the end to arrive at routes 23-25. The routes are listed from left to right. Wall Sun:",
