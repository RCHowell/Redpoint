Climb on crappy quality rock for about 30 feet to another ledge. Pitch 3: This is the money pitch! Directly above pitch 2 is a beautiful dihedral with a thin fingers crack leading to a 12 foot roof which opens to hand/fist size and has some fun gymnastical moves then leads back to some face climbing to another ledge. Here i recommend breaking it into a fourth pitch to reduce rope drag for the last 20 feet to the top. \n\n\n"

  "location": "\n\n\"Larry Day is still alive also! Apologies in advance for the shameless promotion of my own route, but Tower of Power has a somewhat significant roof. In fact it is pretty cool, not your typical RRG type roof but more of a Gunks kind of problem. Geezer, it really shouldnt be too hard to spot. Directly above the crack that forms the first pitch you will see a flake that is somewhat detached from the roof above. Haul your ass up on to that flake and sit astride it in a kind of mambo? stance. You know what I mean, leaning way back, cause the roof will be right in your face. Reach way out to the lip and you will find a great hold, and best of all a bomber tricam (1.5 or maybe a 2) placement in a vertical crack (slotted, not cammed). Screw up your courage, pull the roof, and KEEP YOUR %#^ TOGETHER because its kinda run out on 5.10 face above. Its way exhilarating, and not nearly so hard as Insanity Ceiling. Together with the stupendous first pitch it is truly one of the best old school climbs in the gorge. I am really not trying to sandbag anyone. The first pitch starts out somewhat ugly and strange, then becomes beautiful beyond belief. Then there is the matter of the runout above the roof. Definitely a place where only the big boys and girls should play. One of my favorite climbs anywhere.\"\n-Larry Day, 2001\nTaken from a thread on the now defunct www.climbkentucky.com \n\n\n"

  "location": "\n\nTransworld Depravity starts from the ground about 15 feet to the left of BOHICA, on the far left side of the Madness cave. \n\nIt is pre-equipped with permanent draws except on the dogging bolts. There is a long draw on the first bolt to avoid rope drag and to keep the belayer from swinging off the belay stance when the leader falls, but climbers should stick clip a normal draw for the opening moves to keep from hitting the ground if something breaks. Though the route is roughly 110 feet long, there is no problem getting down from the anchor with a 70 meter rope. It is about 12c for the first 60 feet up to a good rest, and then there is a bouldery move to some sustained hard climbing, up to another tough move. After that it is about 13a to the top, but pretty good rests.\n\n"
